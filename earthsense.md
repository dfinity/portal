# EarthSense

**Tagline:** Passive climate sensing and GreenPoints rewards â€” a climate movement powered by your phone.

**Description:**  
EarthSense turns smartphones into passive environmental data collectors. It rewards users with GreenPoints for logging air pressure, urban noise, and GPS data. This data is stored on the Internet Computer using Motoko-based canisters. Users can earn badges and NFTs based on their real-world climate contributions.
