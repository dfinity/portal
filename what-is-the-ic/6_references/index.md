- Great resources to get a deeper understanding of how all components of the IC work and fit together are the [How it Works](/how-it-works/) page and the [white paper](https://internetcomputer.org/whitepaper.pdf).
- All of the IC's source code is available in [the IC repo](https://github.com/dfinity/ic).
- You can find information on the IC's subnets, nodes, node providers, canisters, NNS proposals, voting, ICP transactions and more on our [dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/).
- Motoko is a novel programming language tailored to smart contracts on the IC. Check out [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko).
