The [Network Nervous System (NNS)](/how-it-works/network-nervous-system-nns/) is the decentralized source of truth regarding the whole IC structure, storing information about all nodes and their allocation to subnets.
The NNS holds the ICP ledger, which tracks the accounts and transactions of the ICP utility token. Token holders can stake ICP tokens and thereby participate in voting about every aspect of the IC, putting ICP stakers in full control (learn more about staking, voting, and rewards [here](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/network-nervous-system-nns/)). It also powers computation on the IC by converting ICP tokens to cycles, which are consumed when running decentralized apps.
The NNS is the worldâ€™s most advanced decentralized autonomous organization [(DAO)](/docs/current/tokenomics/#network-nervous-system-nns).
