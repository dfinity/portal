As its governance system, the Network Nervous System (NNS) provides crucial functionality to the IC.

The NNS holds the ICP ledger, which tracks the accounts and transactions of the ICP utility token.
It enables token holders to stake ICP tokens and thereby participate in voting on every aspect of the IC. For example, stakers may vote to upgrade the IC software or vote to extend the IC by adding a new subnet and so forth (learn more about staking, voting, and rewards [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Staking,_voting_and_rewards)).
Furthermore, the NNS maintains the entire IC structure, such as information about all nodes or their allocation to subnets. It constitutes a single, but decentralized, source of truth.

Moreover, the NNS provides the means to power computation on the IC by converting ICP tokens to *cycles*, which are consumed when running applications.

The NNS is the worldâ€™s most advanced decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Learn more about the NNS [here](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/network-nervous-system-nns/).
