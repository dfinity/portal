The [Network Nervous System (NNS)](/how-it-works/network-nervous-system-nns/)is the worldâ€™s most advanced decentralized autonomous organization [(DAO)](/docs/current/tokenomics/#network-nervous-system-nns). It serves as the decentralized source of truth for the whole Internet Computer structure, as it stores information about all nodes and their allocation to subnets.The NNS holds the ICP ledger, which tracks the accounts and transactions of the ICP utility token. Token holders can stake ICP tokens, which in turn allows them to participate in voting about every aspect of the Internet Computer and earn rewards. The NNS also powers computation on the Internet Computer by converting ICP tokens to cycles, which are burned when running decentralized apps.
