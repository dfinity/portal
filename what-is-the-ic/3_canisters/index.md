A smart contract is a computer program executed on a blockchain. A canister is a smart contract that bundles a computer program and its data. Every canister is hosted on one subnet of the IC.
Canisters can be executed concurrently and communicate within and across subnets by sending asynchronous messages in a non-blocking manner, resulting in essentially unbounded scalability.
Canisters are more powerful than smart contracts on other blockchains as they can
* serve a user interface directly to any web browser,
* hold gigabytes of memory for a low fee
* perform substantial amounts of computation at a low cost, and
* pay for their own computation (learn more about the [reverse gas model](https://internetcomputer.org/features/reverse-gas/)).

Canisters can be implemented in any language that compiles to WebAssembly. Popular canister development kits (CDKs) are available for [Rust](/docs/current/developer-docs/build/cdks/cdk-rs-dfinity/) and [Motoko](/docs/current/developer-docs/build/cdks/motoko-dfinity/motoko/). Other CDKs are described [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/cdks/)
