# Motoko update: January 16, 2023
![Header image](../_assets/motoko-2.png)

Hey Motoko devs,

Happy New Year!

The languages team is back in 2023, hitting the ground running and picking up right where we left off last year. Before
we move on, if you missed our last joint post with the SDK team, check it
out [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sdk-motoko-weekly-update-part-3/17553). As a recap, the languages team left off
last year by focusing on testing and documenting large portions of the Motoko base library.

## New language feature: Motoko timers

![Header image](../_assets/timers.png)

Meet Motoko timers! This is a new language feature that allows you to easily access the timers capability of the
internet computer that lets you schedule asynchronous jobs for the future!

The most straightforward way to access this feature is through the `Timer.mo` base library, which exposes `setTimer`
and `recurringTimer`.

```
setTimer : (d : Duration, job : () -> async ()) -> (id : Nat)
recurringTimer : (d : Duration, job : () -> async ()) -> (id : Nat)
cancelTimer : (id : Nat) -> ()
```

Use `setTimer` to schedule one off jobs that get executed in the future, and `recurringTimer` to auto-repeat these jobs.
The duration can be given in nanoseconds (or seconds if that is more convenient for you). Use `cancelTimer` to remove a
previously set timer.

If you’re a power user that wants precise control over the canister's global timer, you can define a system function
called `timer` yourself, and establish either a super simple or an elaborately customized mechanism. If you want to
avoid any timer-related code in your canister, you can pass the `-no-timer` flag to `moc` and stop paying for what you
don't use. See more details in the PR discussion [here](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/pull/3542).

As a first customer, Motoko playground will use timers to control canister expiration soon.

This feature will be included in the next release of dfx, but is also available in the current release of the Motoko
compiler. Have fun with timers!

## Base library: improved documentation and testing

The languages team was hard at work during the end of year and the start of this year, amongst other things, at testing
and documenting the base library en masse! We’ve added a bunch of descriptions to the library functions, as well as
runnable examples so devs can quickly figure out how to use the different APIs. We’ve also expanded the unit test
coverage of these library modules to give developers a stronger level of confidence in our modules. We’ll be cutting a
release of `motoko-base` soon to get these changes out to you guys, and will also continue to improve the documentation
and testing of our libraries.

## See you next time!

We'll be back with more features and updates in a week’s time. Happy building and happy new year!
