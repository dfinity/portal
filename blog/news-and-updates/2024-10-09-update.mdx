## ICP developer office hours

Developer office hours are back in the ICP developer Discord server! Every Wednesday, two office hour sessions are held in the Discord server's voice chat:

- 7:00 UTC
- 17:30 UTC

Be sure to drop in to the session and ask questions, share your project, or simply listen in on the discussion.

[Join the ICP developer Discord server](https://discord.internetcomputer.org).

## Community spotlight: KongSwap

KongSwap is a decentralized exchange that utilizes ICP's Chain Fusion technology to facilitate cross-chain trading without using a bridge or oracle. KongSwap offers a better, simplified user experience through features such as lower fees and decreased liquidity fragmentation. It is a fully decentralized platform deployed entire onchain with both the frontend and backend components hosted on ICP as canisters.

You can [try KongSwap yourself](https://www.kongswap.io/?viewtab=swap&pool=ICP_ckUSDT) or learn more about the app's architecture, design, and features on the [developer forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-kongswap/35607).

That'll wrap up this week. Tune back in next week for more developer updates!
