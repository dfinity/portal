## Bitcoin x IC Hackathon: BUIDL Bitcoin!
Thereâ€™s a new Hackathon happening, brought to you by Encode Club. This is a chance to build really cool Bitcoin related projects on the IC using the newly fully released ckBTC feature! They also have a Blue Skies track for non-bitcoin related projects.

The Hackathon lasts about a month and will offer various prizes based on placings. Check out the official announcement from Encode Club at this link:

## Candid with auto-formatting and syntax highlighting!
If you guys hadnâ€™t already noticed, the VSCode extension now has auto-formatting and syntax highlighting for Candid files! We hope this quality of life feature will boost your guysâ€™ productivity as we continue to build out the tooling ecosystem for Motoko and the IC!

Let us know if you run into any bugs or have any feedback!

## Till next time!

Keep building, and stay tuned for more updates!
