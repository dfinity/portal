# Developer weekly update April 23, 2025

![April 23, 2025](../../static/img/blog/dev-update-blog-april-23.jpg)

Hello developers, and welcome to this week's developer weekly update! This week, there is a new release of Motoko, an update to the community project CycleOps, and a reminder about OISY wallet. Let's get started!

## Motoko `v0.14.8`

A new version of Motoko is available in the latest beta release of `dfx` (0.26.1-beta.1).

This release concludes the beta testing of enhanced orthogonal persistence and adds random-access indexing of `Blob`s. This update also includes some parser and type checker improvements implemented by the Serokell team.

Lastly, autogenerated Candid now compiles into more readable JavaScript/TypeScript thanks to fewer type synonyms and preservation of named function arguments.

## CycleOps update

The CycleOps team has released an exciting update for topping up your canisters: ICRC deposits! Now, you can fund your canister's automated top-ups directly from an SNS's treasury funds.
