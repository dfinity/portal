# Developer weekly update June 18, 2025

![June 18, 2025](../../static/img/blog/dev-update-blog-june-18.jpg)

Hello developers, and welcome to this week's developer weekly update! This week, there are new releases of the `stable-structures` library and Canbench, plus a new feature for auto-adding cycles to calls to the management canister. Let's get started!

## `stable-structures` v0.6.9

A new release of the `stable-structures` library has been published! This release includes dozens of changes and updates. Here are some of the highlights:

- Performance improvements for read-heavy cases other smaller performance upgrades.

- New BTreeSet structure.

- Initial publication of the Stable Structures Book.

- Improved benchmarks.

- CI and codebase improvements.

## Canbench v0.2.0

Alongside the new `stable-structures` library, a new version of Canbench has also been released. Highlights of `v0.2.0` include:

- Cleaner benchmark output.

- Summary reports that show final status, total benchmarks, improvements, regressions, etc.

- Support for CSV reports through `--csv` flag.

- GitHub CI integration scripts.

## Automatic cycles attachment to management canister calls

Motoko package `ic` v2.1.0 has an exciting new feature: Automatic cycle calculation!

For example, instead of hardcoding cycles amounts:

```motoko no-repl
await (with cycles = 230_949_972_000) IC.http_request(args)
```

Now, you can use:

```motoko no-repl
import IC "mo:ic/Call";
...
await IC.httpRequest(args)
```

This will calculate the minimum amount of cycles needed and automatically attach them to the call.

[Learn more in the `ic` Mops package documentation](https://mops.one/ic/docs/Call).

That'll wrap up this week. Tune back in next week for more developer updates!
