# Developer weekly update December 6, 2023

![December 6 2023](../../static/img/blog/dev-update-blog-dev-6.jpg)

Hello developers and welcome back to developer weekly! This week, we have some very exciting announcements about ckETH, an EU subnet proposal, and the final level of the developer liftoff series! Let's get started.

## ckETH: now live!

On Friday, December 1st, the NNS proposals to enable ckETH on ICP went live. We're excited to announce that all proposals were passed by the NNS, and ckETH is now live on the mainnet!

ckETH has been added to the ICP dashboard, which you can view [here](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/ethereum). You can learn how to interact with ckETH by reviewing the ckETH minter documentation [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/ethereum/cketh/minter/README.adoc).

ckETH support is also live in the ICRC-1 wallet, which includes ckETH has a pre-defined token. The index canister has been integrated, allowing you to mint directly to your principal. The ICRC-1 wallet canister can be found [here](https://e4hv6-7yaaa-aaaao-a2ida-cai.icp0.io/)

With the current ckETH integration, you will not be able to withdraw to ETH directly from the ICRC-1 wallet. This is because the ICRC-1 wallet does not support the withdrawal process (withdraws are supported in the ICRC-2 standard). To withdraw ckETH for ETH, you can send your ckETH to your dfx principal, then withdraw from there following [these steps](https://github.com/timohanke/ic/blob/d34903fc2c41e2cff5df86248628f5d0b4fd7168/rs/ethereum/cketh/minter/README.adoc#withdrawal-cketh-to-eth).

To encourage you to try it out, the first person who logs into the ICRC-1 wallet using the “Seed method” with seed “ckETH”, then adds the subaccount whose index is “ckETH” in hex will find some ETH in it!

You can join the forum discussion [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/cketh-a-canister-issued-ether-twin-token-on-the-ic/22819/95) to let us know your thoughts on ckETH and report any bugs you might encounter.

## EU subnet NNS proposal

Another new and exciting proposal is now live for voting on the NNS. This proposal is the first of three proposals that proposes launching an EU subnet! Adding this subnet would be a huge milestone in enabling GDPR-compliant services on ICP.

This proposal will create a new subnet type of 'European'. If this initial proposal passes, two additional proposals will be submitted. The first will propose the creation of a subnet with only node machines located in the European geographic region, and a second proposal will assign the subnet type 'European' to the newly created subnet.

This new subnet type will enable developers and enterprises alike to benefit from:

- Building and deploying applications that require a GDPR-aligned infrastructure.

- Building and deploying applications that leverage blockchain decentralization with regional data sovereignty needs.

It is important to note that while the creation of an EU subnet would enable applications to be GDPR-compliant, developers and enterprises will need to take further measures to ensure that their applications meet all GDPR requirements.

You can join the discussion on the forum [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/european-subnet-on-the-internet-computer-a-step-toward-gdpr-ready-infrastructure/25110), and you can vote on the first proposal [here](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126328)

## Developer liftoff level 5
