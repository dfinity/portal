# Developer weekly update November 6, 2024

![November 6 2024](../../static/img/blog/dev-update-blog-nov-6.jpg)

Hello developers, and welcome to this week's developer weekly update! This week, there is an announcement regarding improvements to verifiable credentials, a new developer liftoff video, and a community spotlight for ICPTopup.com. Let's get started!

## Verifiable credentials: new field and Rust crate

A proposal has been submitted to upgrade Internet Identity and add a new field to the alias credentials for verifiable credential issuers and relying parties: `derivationOrigin`. This field contains the URL that was used to derive the verifiable credential issuer or relying party user principal. It is recommended that the verifiable credential issuer and relying party both check that this URL has the correct value.

In addition to this proposed change, the Rust crate `ic-verifiable-credentials` has been published. This crate can be used to issue verifiable credentials and verify ID alias credentials received from an identity provider.

You can [view the proposal](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=133801) for more information or [download the Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/ic-verifiable-credentials) to start using these features in your Rust canisters.

## ICP developer liftoff 5.2

A new episode of the ICP developer liftoff video series has been released! In this episode, "Deploying an ETH starter project on ICP," developers will learn how to use the EVM RPC canister to interact with the Ethereum network from within an ICP canister. The starter project is built using Motoko, React, and the EVM RPC canister. This tutorial is a great first step to building powerful cross-chain applications!

You can watch the [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XHbK5yn_8s) or follow the written [tutorial](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-5/5.2-ICP-ETH-tutorial).

## Community spotlight: ICPTopup.com

From the team behind CycleOps, a new canister management tool has been released! ICPTopup.com is designed to be the easiest way to top up canisters. You can provide ICPTopup with multiple canister IDs at once, then choose the amount each canister should be topped up, add funds, and you're good to go!

ICPTopup uses ICRC-2 approvals, which allow the service to use a single API call to top up canisters.

[Learn more on the developer forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/icptopup-com-the-easiest-way-to-top-up-canisters-with-cycles/36434).

That'll wrap up this week. Tune back in next week for more developer updates!
