# Developer weekly update October 4, 2023

![October 4 2023](../../static/img/blog/dev-update-blog-sept-20.jpg)

Hello developers and welcome to this week's developer weekly update! This week, we have a wide variety of updates for you, including a proposal to deprecate the Service Worker, a new `dfx` release, and a new sample project that showcases ckBTC in a point of sale environment.

Let's get started!

## SNS office hours

This week, we introduce a new office hour dedicated to SNSes! During this office hour, SNS teams and community members can join a call together to discuss technical questions regarding SNSes with the DFINITY team.

These office hour sessions will be every other Wednesday at 5PM GMT+2 / 8AM PST. Each session will be 30 minutes, and will begin on October 18th. The sessions will last through the end of November, for a total of 4 sessions.

You can find more information on the [forum post here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcing-sns-office-hours/23506).

## Proposal to deprecate the Service Worker

Last week, a [new post here](/blog/features/deprecating-the-service-worker) on the Dev Blog announced a proposal to deprecate the Service Worker in favor of replacing it with the ICX Proxy hosted on the boundary nodes. The benefits of this proposal include:

- Enhanced user experience.
- Faster initial page loading.
- Consistent branding.
- Availability.
- Reduced cognitive load.
- Providing features for progressive web apps.
- Content encoding.
- Lighthouse support.

To migrate away from the Service Worker, the roadmap for this proposal includes milestones in creating alternative HTTP gateways, federated HTTP gateways, and decentralized HTTP gateways.

## `dfx v0.15.1`

This week, `dfx v0.15.1` has been released, which includes a very anticipated feature: deploy to playground!

We've been hyping up this feature for several weeks now, since it creates an easy on-ramp to deploying canisters without needing cycles or setting up local identities, simply by using the `--network playground` flag.

In addition to the deploy to playground feature, other features in this release include:

- Support for `reserved_cycles` and `reserved_cycles_limit`: the output of `dfx canister status` now displays the reserved cycles balance and limit for a canister. Limits for a canister can be set using `dfx canister create --reserved-cycles-limit <LIMIT>` and `dfx canister update-settings --reserved-cycles-limit <LIMIT>`.

-  Emit management canister IDL when imported by Motoko canister, which will automatically produce the IDL in the `.dfx` folder.

- Support for the `--version` tag for `dfx extension install`, allowing for a specific version of an extension to be installed.

- Updated handling of missing values in state tree certificates.
The Unknown lookup of a path in a certificate results in an AgentError (ICP returns Absent for non-existing paths).

- The flag `--ic` can now be used as shorthand for `--network ic`.

The full release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/50a0e25c58962e0b4a840798c0912c60dc107c57/CHANGELOG.md).

## IC-POS

This week, a new sample application has been added to the DFINITY `examples` repo! This example showcases a real-world use case for ckBTC that creates a point of sale application, allowing users to accept payments in ckBTC.

This app includes features such as:

- Creating a store that users can configure with products to sell. Users can log into their store with their Internet Identity.

- Functionality to charge customers by entering an amount, then generating a QR code that the customer can scan to pay. The QR code follows the ICRC-22 standard.

- Functionality to send tokens, where users can send ckBTC to other users.

- Notifications that can be sent whenever a payment is received. These notifications use HTTPS outcalls to send emails or SNS notifications.

- Functionality to display transaction history of all transactions made within the store.

This example has a [full documentation tutorial](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/ic-pos) showcasing how to setup and deploy the project.. Additionally, the project's code can be found within the DFINITY examples repo [here](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/ic-pos).

That'll wrap things up for this week! We'll see everyone again for the next issue of developer weekly!
