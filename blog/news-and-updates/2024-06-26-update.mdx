# Developer weekly update June 26, 2024

![June 26 2024](../../static/img/blog/dev-update-blog-june-26.jpg)

Hello developers, and welcome to this week's developer weekly update! In this week's update, we're excited to share several new pages of documentation, a proposal for a new ckERC20 token, and provide information about upcoming ICP events. Let's get started!

## New docs

This week, the ICP Dev Docs received several new additions, including digital asset pages for wallets and NFTs, plus new Chain Fusion pages that detail ckERC20 tokens and a list of different chains supported by ICP. Here are the details:

- [Wallet overview](/docs/defi/overview): Learn about types of asset wallets on ICP.

- [NFTs overview](/docs/defi/overview): Learn about ICP's NFT standards, ICRC-7 and ICRC-37.

- [NFT collections](/docs/defi/overview): A tutorial using ICRC-7 to deploy your own NFT collection.

- [NFT marketplaces](/docs/defi/overview): A list of dapps on ICP that support buying and selling NFTs.

- [Supported chains](/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/supported-chains): A list of chains that ICP can integrate with using native integrations or an RPC service through HTTPS outcalls

- [ckERC20 overview](/docs/defi/chain-key-tokens/ckerc20/overview): Learn about ckERC20 tokens, such as ckUSDC and ckLINK.

- [ckERC20 transactions](/docs/defi/chain-key-tokens/ckerc20/making-transactions): Swap ckERC20 tokens for ERC20 tokens and vice versa.

- [ckERC20 in dapps](/docs/defi/chain-key-tokens/ckerc20/using-ckerc20-in-dapps): Learn how to target a ledger canister in your code for ckERC20 tokens.

## ckPEPE proposal

A new ckERC20 token has been proposed! So far, we've seen the deployment of ckUSDC and ckLINK on ICP, but a third token has been submitted to the NNS for approval: ckPEPE! This would be a chain-key twin token of the PEPE ERC-20 token deployed on Ethereum. PEPE is considered a 'memecoin', meaning it was named after a character, individual, animal, or piece of artwork, and is used for entertainment purposes.

That'll wrap up this week. Tune back in next week for more developer updates!
