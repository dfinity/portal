# Developer weekly update May 28, 2025

![May 28, 2025](../../static/img/blog/dev-update-blog-may-28.jpg)

Hello developers, and welcome to this week's developer weekly update! This week, there are new documentation pages on the vetKeys feature, an update on the Solana RPC canister, and a request for feedback from the community. Let's get started!

## vetKeys documentation

Documentation for the new vetKeys feature has been published! Dive into the new feature and learn about different use cases through these new pages:

- [What are vetKeys?](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/introduction) Learn about what vetKeys are, their benefits and use cases, and examples of applications that utilize them.

- [vetKD API](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/api): Reference documentation for the vetKeys API endpoints.

- [Distributed key management service](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/dkms): Learn about the ready-to-use KeyManager solution that offers access control and vetKey derivation.

- [Encrypted onchain storage](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/encrypted-onchain-storage): Learn about the ready-to-use EncryptedMaps solution for encrypted onchain storage.

## SOL RPC canister

The Solana RPC canister is ready for testing on the mainnet! At a very high level, the SOL RPC canister offers the same services to canisters as if a Solana RPC node were directly available on the ICP mainnet.

Check out the [SOL RPC canister README](https://github.com/dfinity/sol-rpc-canister/blob/main/README.md) for detailed usage instructions, including how to query data and how to sign and submit SOL transactions.

## Request for feedback: ICRC-103 (query allowances) on the ICP ledger

Attention developers! We're asking for your feedback regarding ICRC-103 (query allowances) on the ICP ledger. 

Do you a practical, minimal path that solves immediate concerns while preserving privacy and stability, or do you think itâ€™s worth pushing toward ICRC-103 compliance, even with the limitations and transitional pain?

Read all the details and give your input on the [developer forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/standard-for-managing-icrc-2-approvals-a-challenge-for-the-icp-ledger/32997/13?u=marc0olo).

That'll wrap up this week. Tune back in next week for more developer updates!
