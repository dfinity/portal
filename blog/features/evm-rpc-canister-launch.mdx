# Summary

Today we're excited to announce that the
[EVM RPC canister](https://github.com/internet-computer-protocol/evm-rpc-canister/releases/tag/release-2024-01-31)
is now available for use! It is currently in beta, and will be while we iron out
any kinks to ensure that it meets all the demands of your dapps safely and
performantly. Test it out yourself and let us know if you run into any issues by
either
[opening up an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/internet-computer-protocol/evm-rpc-canister/issues/new)
or submitting feedback on the
[ICP Feedback Board](https://dx.internetcomputer.org).

## What is it?

The EVM RPC canister is a service that lets you easily build integrations
between ICP canister smart contracts and Ethereum smart contracts. It simplifies
the process of procuring, managing, and paying for API keys for various
[EVM RPC providers](https://www.alchemy.com/best/rpc-node-providers). It also
helps keep dapps secure by automatically inferring consensus among multiple RPC
providers with each outbound request.

## The problem

Building an integration between a canister and the Ethereum network currently
requires the use of HTTPS outcalls. These calls are facilitated by services
(often called RPC node providers) that require the use of subscription-based API
keys. This presents developers with a few non-trivial challenges:

### Management of API keys

RPC providers for Ethereum typically charge a subscription-based fee in order to
use their services. While some offer free tiers, the quotas can be exhausted
quickly in a production setting.

Furthermore, it is not straightforward to manage an API key (let alone multiple)
in the context of a canister. There are a number of challenges to overcome:

- How do you ensure that a single developer managing API keys does not pose a
  centralization risk to the users of the dapp?

- What if you just want to kick the tires?

- What if you want to build something quickly?

- How do you keep your API keys secret?

### Cost, complexity, and consensus

The problem is further compounded if we start to take cost into account. There
are a number of factors that go into the calculation a developer makes when
deciding to build something:

- How much engineering effort will this take?

- How much do I need to pay for third-party services (e.g. Ethereum RPC
  providers)?

- How important is trust and security to my users?

If managing API keys independently, the total cost begins to balloon as usage
scales and the need for additional layers of consensus becomes more important -
the latter requires querying multiple RPC providers, which each require an
individual subscription, API key, management, etc.

## What the EVM RPC canister solves

The EVM RPC canister abstracts away much of the complexity around managing keys
and querying the Ethereum network for blocks, transactions, and other data with
an easy to use, onchain API. It performs automatic consensus inference by
sending requests to multiple providers in parallel and ensuring the responses
agree. It also lets you send requests to other EVM chains through a generic
`request` interface. Overall, it simplifies what you as a developer need to
think about when setting up your Ethereum integrations.

## How to use

Below is a quick start to getting an integration with the EVM RPC canister up
and running. It's a simplified example that omits many complexities, but
hopefully it still shows you how easy it is to get started.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
:::info
Please ensure you [install](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install) `dfx` before proceeding with the steps below.
:::
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Start a new project

```bash
dfx new evm_rpc_example
cd evm_rpc_example
```

### Add the EVM RPC canister as a dependency

Using `dfx deps` we can automatically install the EVM RPC canister wasm into our
local environment.

Edit the `dfx.json` file at the root of your project to add the EVM RPC canister
as a dependency under the "canisters" key:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "evm_rpc": {
      "type": "pull",
      "id": "7hfb6-caaaa-aaaar-qadga-cai"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "args": "",
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env",
  "version": 1
}
```

Next, from your terminal, run the following command to fetch all dependencies:

```bash
dfx deps pull
```

Start the local development environment:

```bash
dfx start --clean --background
```

Set the init args for the EVM RPC canister:

```bash
dfx deps init evm_rpc --argument '(record { nodesInSubnet = 31 })'
```

Locally deploy the `evm_rpc` canister:

```bash
dfx deps deploy evm_rpc
```

Now, use `dfx` to get the current Ethereum gas price:

```bash
dfx canister call evm_rpc request '(variant {Custom=record {url="https://ethereum.publicnode.com"}},"{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_gasPrice\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}",1000)' --wallet $(dfx identity get-wallet) --with-cycles 1000000000
```

The response:

```bash
(variant { Ok = "{\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":\"0x8ca25b481\"}" })
```

#### Raw RPC

You might be asking why the gas price is returned as a hex value. This endpoint
was reached using the generic `request` method expose by the EVM RPC canister.
This endpoint does not offer the same conveniences as the typed Candid RPC
endpoints, nor does it perform automatic consensus inference. This method is
exposed primarily to give you access to any Ethereum RPC API method in case the
typed Candid RPC endpoints are not sufficient.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
:::info
In the coming months, more tooling and improvements to the EVM RPC canister are expected to be released that will make it much easier to process raw Ethereum RPC data.
:::
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Candid RPC

Let's see what it looks like to call a typed Candid RPC method.

```bash
dfx canister call evm_rpc eth_getTransactionCount '(variant {EthMainnet = opt vec {variant {Cloudflare}}}, null, record {address = "0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7"; block = variant {Latest}})' --with-cycles 1000000000 --wallet=$(dfx identity get-wallet)
```

Here, we call the `eth_getTransactionCount` method using Cloudflare as a
provider. This will return the number of transactions for the given contract
(i.e. address `0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7`)

We get back the following, which tells us there is one transaction:

```bash
(variant { Consistent = variant { Ok = 1 : nat } })
```

## Bonus

The indomitable @rvanasa put together a small example that shows how to call the
EVM RPC canister from a Motoko canister. Check it out:

## Conclusion

The EVM RPC canister is designed to help you build integrations with Ethereum
smart contracts quickly, easily, and in a cost-effective manner. While it is
still early (and there are many improvements to come), this is a good chance to
get ahead and build slick ICP cross-chain dapps!

If you have any feedback, or feel that the EVM RPC canister is missing any
features or functionality, please write on
[GitHub](https://github.com/internet-computer-protocol/evm-rpc-canister), on the
[Developer Forum](https://forum.dfinity.org), or on the
[Feedback Board](https://dx.internetcomputer.org).

Looking forward to your comments!
