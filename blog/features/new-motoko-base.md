# Try the new Motoko core library: feedback requested!

[![Motoko core library](/img/blog/new-motoko-base.jpg)](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core)

* [Developer forum topic](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motoko-base-library-changes/39766)
* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core)
* [Online starter project](https://icp.ninja/s/kwKkw)

The Motoko team is excited to announce a major overhaul of the Motoko base library! Our goal is to improve the consistency and usability of Motokoâ€™s standard library, making it easier for both humans and AI to read and write Motoko canisters.

Here is a quick summary of the biggest features and improvements:

* New imperative and functional data structures.
* Simplified type conversions.
* Data structures no longer rely on hashing.
* `range()` functions for each numeric type, with an exclusive upper bound.
* `VarArray` module for more conveniently working with mutable arrays.
* `Random` module with a cleaner API and optional pseudo-random number generation.
* Many other changes for consistency, clarity, and convenience.

## Try it yourself

Last week, we released a preview of the new core library with a few different options for trying it out. One is through the [`core`](https://mops.one/core) Mops package. Add the following to your `mops.toml` config file:

```toml
core = "0.0.0" # Check https://mops.one/core for the latest version
```

Alternatively, you can directly replace the `mo:base` imports in an existing project:

```toml
base = "https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core"
```

Let us know if you run into anything unexpected by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core/issues).

## What's changed?

Below is a detailed overview of the most notable changes and additions.

### Persistent data structures

The base library now includes both imperative (mutable) and purely functional (immutable) data structures which can all be used in stable memory. Because Motoko is a multi-paradigm language, we wanted to reflect this in the base library by providing data structures similar to those in imperative languages (JS, Java, C#, C++) and functional languages (Haskell, Elixir, OCaml, F#).

Check out [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/linq/functional-vs-imperative-programming) for a refresher on the differences between imperative vs. functional programming, both of which are supported in Motoko.

We chose implementations with good all-round performance, deferring specialized implementations to the [Mops](https://mops.one/) package ecosystem. We also updated function names for consistency and familiarity from other languages such as JS, Python, Java, and Rust.

Below is an example of using the new imperative `List` module, derived from the [`vector`](https://mops.one/vector) Mops package (big thanks to [Andrii Stepanov and Timo Hanke](https://github.com/research-ag)):

```motoko no-repl
import List "mo:core/List";
import Nat "mo:core/Nat";

actor {
  stable let list = List.empty<Nat>(); // Persistent data structure
  List.add(list, 5);
  assert List.toText(list, Nat.toText) == "[5]";
}
```

The above code snippet can be rewritten as a new `persistent` actor:

```motoko no-repl
import List "mo:core/List";

persistent actor {
  let list = List.empty<Nat>(); // Persistent data structure
  ...
}
```

You can also use the purely functional `List` module:

```motoko no-repl
import PureList "mo:core/pure/List";

persistent actor {
  var list = PureList.empty<Text>(); // Persistent data structure
  list := PureList.pushFront(list, "Hi");
  assert PureList.size(list) == 1;
  assert PureList.all<Text>(list, func(n) { n == "Hi" });
}
```

We also included an efficient [stable BTree map implementation](https://github.com/canscale/StableHeapBTreeMap) (big thanks to [Byron Becker](https://github.com/ByronBecker)):

```motoko no-repl
import Map "mo:core/Map";
import Text "mo:core/Text";
import Array "mo:core/Array";

persistent actor {
  let map = Map.empty<Text, Nat>();
  Map.add(map, Text.compare, "key", 123);
  assert Map.size(map) == 1;
  Array.fromIter(Map.entries(map)) == [("key", 123)];
}
```

Here's the complete list of data structures in the new base library:

* `List` (adapted from [`vector`](https://mops.one/vector) Mops package)
* `Map` (adapted from [`StableHeapBTreeMap`](https://mops.one/stableheapbtreemap) Mops package)
* `Queue`
* `Set`
* `Stack`
* `pure/List`
* `pure/Map`
* `pure/Queue`
* `pure/Set`

### New type conversions

Since the new base library includes imperative and functional data structures,
we made it easy to convert between them:

```motoko no-repl
import List "mo:core/List";
import PureList "mo:core/pure/List";
import Text "mo:core/Text";

persistent actor {
  let list = List.singleton<Text>("A");

  let pureList = List.toPure<Text>(list);
  assert PureList.toArray(pureList) == ["A"];
  assert List.equal<Text>(List.fromPure(pureList), list, Text.equal);
}
```

We also added missing primitive type conversions such as those between `Int` and `Nat`:

```motoko no-repl
import Int "mo:core/Int";
import Nat "mo:core/Nat";

persistent actor {
  let number = -5;
  
  assert Int.toNat(-number) == 5; // Nat.fromInt() also exists
  assert -Nat.toInt(5 : Nat) == number; // Int.fromNat() also exists
}
```

### Hashing

We removed 32-bit hashing from the base library in favor of comparison-based data structures. This solves a number of problems such as hash-collision attacks which can rapidly drain cycles from a canister. The idea is for Mops packages to supply hashing functions which are best suited for a particular use case. 

### Range functions

`Iter.range()` has been removed in favor of type-specific range functions such as `Nat.range()`, `Int.range()`, `Nat32.range()`, etc. These functions have an **exclusive upper bound**, in contrast to the original inclusive upper bound of `Iter.range()`. 

```motoko no-repl
import Int "mo:core/Int";
import Debug "mo:core/Debug";

persistent actor {
  // Iterate through -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 (exclusive upper bound)
  for (number in Int.range(-3, 3)) {
    Debug.print(debug_show number);
  };

  // Iterate through -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3
  for (number in Int.rangeInclusive(-3, 3)) {
    Debug.print(debug_show number);
  };
}
```

We also included `rangeInclusive()` for use cases with an inclusive upper bound. The original `Iter.range()` corresponds to `Nat.rangeInclusive()`.

Helper functions have been added, such as `allValues()`, for each finite type in the base library. 

### VarArray module

For convenience, we created a separate `mo:core/VarArray` module with the same API as `mo:core/Array` but for mutable arrays. This reduces the need to convert back and forth between mutable and immutable arrays:

```motoko no-repl
import Array "mo:core/Array";
import VarArray "mo:core/VarArray";
import Char "mo:core/Char";
import Nat "mo:core/Nat";

persistent actor {
  let array = Array.repeat<Char>('A', 3);
  assert array == ['A', 'A', 'A'];

  let varArray = VarArray.repeat<Char>('B', 5);
  assert VarArray.equal(varArray, [var 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'], Char.equal);

  let numbers = VarArray.fromIter<Nat>(Nat.range(0, 4));
  VarArray.mapInPlace<Nat>(numbers, func(i) = i * 3);
  assert VarArray.equal(numbers, [var 0, 3, 6, 9], Nat.equal);
}
```

It's now possible to use `.values()` as an alias for `.vals()`. Each data structure has a corresponding `values()` function, e.g. `List.values(list)`.

We also fixed naming inconsistencies in functions by replacing `ArrayMut` with `VarArray` across the base library.

### Random module

We completely redesigned the `Random` module, which is now a lot simpler to use:

```motoko no-repl
import Random "mo:core/Random";

actor {
  let random = Random.crypto(); // Cryptographic random numbers from ICP runtime

  public func coinFlip() : async Bool {
    await* random.bool()
  };

  public func randomItem(items : [Text]) : async Text {
    items[await* random.natRange(0, items.size())]
  };
}
```

Now, you can use pseudo-random number generation, adapted from the [`prng`](https://mops.one/prng) Mops package (big thanks to [Andrii Stepanov and Timo Hanke](https://github.com/research-ag)):

```motoko no-repl
import Random "mo:core/Random";

actor {
  let seed : Nat64 = 12345;
  let random = Random.fast(seed); // Pseudo-random number generator from a seed

  public func coinFlip() : async Bool {
    random.bool()
  };

  public func randomItem(items : [Text]) : async Text {
    items[random.natRange(0, items.size())]
  };
}
```

It's worth mentioning that the `Random` module is likely to see more changes in the future, such as adding a way to persist the state of pseudo-random number generation.

## What's next?

Before replacing the current Motoko base library, we have a list of follow-up improvements:

* Creating a migration guide for a smooth transition from the original base library.
* Updating the documentation with more examples and detailed explanations.
* Improving test coverage of new functionality.
* Adding new language capabilities for more convenient design patterns.
