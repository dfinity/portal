# Chain-key Bitcoin

The Bitcoin integration on the Internet Computer rests on two pillars: Chain-key transactions and a direct interaction between Internet Computer nodes and the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network.
While chain-key transactions make it possible for canisters to have their own Bitcoin addresses and create valid transactions spending bitcoins held by these addresses,
the direct message exchange between the Internet Computer and the Bitcoin network serves to maintain information about the Bitcoin blockchain state, such as address balances, in the Internet Computer
and to transmit Bitcoin transactions originating from canisters to the Bitcoin network.
