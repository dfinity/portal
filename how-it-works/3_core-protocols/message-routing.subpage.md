[![Watch youtube video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YexfeByBXlo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YexfeByBXlo)

The Internet Computer blockchain enables users to send messages to canister smart contracts and canisters to send messages between themselves. For scalability, the Internet Computer is composed of many subnet blockchains and the Internet Computer's Network Nervous System can add new subnets as required. The message routing component routes messages to and from canisters across all of the Internet Computer's subnet blockchains and ensures that new subnets can be added seamlessly.
