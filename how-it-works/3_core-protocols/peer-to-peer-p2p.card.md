# Peer-to-Peer Layer

The Internet Computer blockchain is designed to be secure, reliable, and scalable. Scalability is provided through subnet blockchains that run Canister smart contracts on a selection of nodes. The peer-to-peer layer ("P2P") enables reliable and secure communication between nodes participating in the same subnet. P2P collects and advertises messages from users, as well as from other nodes, so that they will eventually be replicated across all nodes in the same subnet blockchain.
