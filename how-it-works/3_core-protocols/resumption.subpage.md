The Internet Computer blockchain is powered by nodes located in numerous independent data centers around the world. These nodes are running the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that ensures security and reliability for canister smart contracts through sufficient replication of canister state and computation. In this talk, the parts of the protocol are explained that enable nodes to catch up to the lasted replicated state and to resume participation in the blockchain after they have been disconnected from the network. The same mechanism is also key when a new node gets added to one of the Internet Computer's subnet blockchains.
