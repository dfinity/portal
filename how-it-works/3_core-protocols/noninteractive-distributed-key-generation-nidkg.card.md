# [Noninteractive Distributed Key Generation](/how-it-works/noninteractive-distributed-key-generation-nidkg/)

NIDKG is a cryptographic protocol to distributedly generate key shares for each of the nodes participating in a subnet blockchain. It applies advanced cryptography, including encryption with forward secrecy and noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs of correct key sharing.
