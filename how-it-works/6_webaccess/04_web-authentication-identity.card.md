# Internet Identity

The main means of identity and authentication used on the web are usernames and passwords, which are hard to manage and well-known for their security vulnerabilities. To solve these pitfalls, the Internet Computer blockchain pioneered a more advanced and much more secure method of cryptographic authentication, known as Internet Identity, which is more convenient to use, works across all of a user's devices, and helps to protect user privacy.

Internet Identity is a gateway to applications on the Internet Computer. When you use Internet Identity, websites cannot collect and share information about your online activity. This is because Internet Identity helps you create and manage anonymous, independent accounts for every website so that you get the privacy of having many different accounts without the burden of managing them.
