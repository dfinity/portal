# Infinite scalability

Ever wondered about the meaning behind DFINITY? It’s Decentralized + Infinity. It’s named that way because the Internet Computer is designed to scale infinitely. It means that the Internet Computer can host an unlimited number of canisters (smart contracts), store an unlimited amount of memory, process an unlimited amount of transactions per second. In simple words, Internet Computer is designed to host even large scale social media platforms in a fully decentralized way. 

There are two types of widely-used approaches to improve the scalability of a system. (1) Vertical Scaling, and (2) Horizontal Scaling. Vertical scaling means adding more CPU, RAM and disk to a single computer. Horizontal scaling means adding more computers to the system. There is a limit to vertical scaling. But with horizontal scaling, one can achieve unlimited scalability. Internet Computer is one of the first blockchains to successfully use horizontal scaling. 

The nodes in the Internet Computer are divided into subnets, each containing a few dozen nodes. The set of nodes in a subnet together maintain one blockchain. Each subnet can host a few thousand canisters and process messages received by those canisters. Each subnet has a limited capacity in terms of the number of canisters (a few thousand), amount of storage (a few TB), and bandwidth (a few hundred transactions per second). But as more subnets are added to the Internet Computer, its overall capacity increases proportionately. There is no limit on the number of subnets that can be added, resulting in unlimited scalability. 

Creating a new subnet has two steps.  1) Adding new nodes to the Internet Computer,  and  2) Creating a subnet with the available nodes
Anyone can purchase the node hardware and add it to the Internet Computer by following the [node provider onboarding process](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding). 

We now describe how to create a new subnet with the available nodes. The Internet Computer has a decentralized governance system called Network Nervous System (NNS). Essentially, NNS consists of a group of canisters that manage the Internet Computer. In the NNS, there is a component called “registry”, which stores all the configurations of the Internet Computer. The registry has a record for each subnet which includes a protocol version, the list of nodes in the subnet, protocol configuration parameters, etc. 

To add a new subnet, one has to submit a “proposal” in the NNS to add a record for a new subnet in the registry. The proposal consists of the list of nodes to be included in the new subnet. The proposal can be voted by anyone who staked their ICP tokens. If a majority of voters accept the proposal, then the registry canister instructs the NNS subnet to generate - in a fully decentralized way using [chain-key cryptography](/how-it-works/chain-key-technology/) - computes the cryptographic key material to be used by the new subnet and a catch up package containing the genesis block. The registry canister then adds a record containing the configuration of the subnet. 

We now describe how a new subnet is created after a record is added to the registry. Each node runs 2 pieces of software — (1) Replica and (2) Orchestrator. Replica consists of the 4-layer software stack that maintains the blockchain. Orchestrator downloads and manages the replica software.  When a new node is onboarded, the node provider has to install IC OS on the node, which contains the orchestrator software. The orchestrator regularly queries the NNS registry for any updates. If the orchestrator sees that the node is included in a registry record, then the orchestrator downloads the corresponding replica software, and runs the replica with the Catch Up Package included in the registry as input. 

When the replica software runs, it first runs a distributed key generation protocol to generate the cryptographic keys necessary for signing the blockchain state. The replica then starts accepting messages and the consensus protocol extends the genesis block present in the catch up package.
