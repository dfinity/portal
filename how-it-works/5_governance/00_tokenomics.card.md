The Internet Computer (IC) is underpinned by advanced tokenomics. 
It makes use of an utility token called ICP, which is used for a variety of functions on the platform including participation in governance and paying for computation & storage. 
In addition, the IC's tokenomic model provides a funding framework for exciting Web3 projects being built on the Internet Computer.
