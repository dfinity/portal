# Boundary nodes

The boundary nodes are the gateway to the Internet Computer and enable seamless
access to the canister smart contracts with stock browsers. They provide an HTTP
endpoint and translate all incoming user requests to API canister calls, which
are processed on-chain. In addition, the boundary nodes act as a cache to improve
the performance of the dapps hosted on the Internet Computer.
