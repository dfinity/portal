# Network Nervous System

The Network Nervous System (NNS) is the DAO that controls the Internet Computer blockchain. It is a permissionless, stake-based governance system, where everyone can participate by staking ICP utility tokens. Decisions are made by voting on proposals in a liquid democracy, meaning that voters can either vote directly or delegate their voting power to other voters. The NNS governs all aspects of the Internet Computer, including its tokenomics, the rules of the NNS governance itself, the topology of the node machines, and the software that is run on the node machines. All these decisions are executed fully onchain, which eliminates the need for trusted third parties.
