# Network Nervous System

The Internet Computer is a *decentralized* system run by many independent nodes. The *Network Nervous System (NNS)* coordinates their effort by determining which subnet a node belongs to (the topology), which protocol version they should run, and when they should upgrade to a new protocol version.

NNS decision making is done via an open tokenized governance system. The NNS is one of the largest decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Anyone can become a participant of the NNS by staking ICP tokens and contribute to decisions.
