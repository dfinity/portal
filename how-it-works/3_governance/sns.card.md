# Service Nervous System (SNS)

Similarly to how the Internet Computer (IC) is controlled by the Network Nervous System, an individual application on the IC (called *dapp*) can be controlled by a decentralized community. The Internet Computer’s built-in solution for a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) that *tokenizes* and *decentralizes* a dapp is called the Service Nervous System (SNS). In the process of creating an SNS, new tokens are minted and sold in a community-based fundraising. The dapp’s control is handed over to the SNS and everyone who has SNS tokens can contribute to decisions on how the dapp evolves going forward. 
This allows distributing the power and ownership of the dapp over a number of parties, thereby eliminating single points of failure and gaining censorship resistance. Moreover, the newly created tokens can be used to create incentives to foster user adoption and participation.
