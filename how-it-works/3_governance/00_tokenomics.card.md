# Tokenomics

The Internet Computer makes use of an utility token called ICP. The ICP token is used for a variety of functions on the platform. Users can stake ICP giving them the right to vote and earn voting rewards paid in ICP. Investors can use ICP to invest in SNS sales launched on the Internet Computer, i.e., the initial offerings of the native DAOs. Developers use ICP token to purchase cycles to power their dapps on the Internet Computer. And node providers are renumerated for the compute power they provide to the Internet Computer platform.
