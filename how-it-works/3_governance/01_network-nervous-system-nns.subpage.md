The Network Nervous System (NNS) is the open algorithmic system governing the Internet Computer blockchain. Its most notable innovations include its ability to upgrade the Internet Computer protocol and software running on node machines, onboard new node providers, add node machines into the blockchain network, and create new subnet blockchains to increase capacity. Anyone can participate in the NNS by staking ICP tokens into one or more neurons. Neurons can submit proposals and decide to adopt or reject them. The NNS implements liquid democracy: neurons can follow other neurons a delegate voting power.
