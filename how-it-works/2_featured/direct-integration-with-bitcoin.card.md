# Direct Integration with Bitcoin

The Internet Computer protocol has been extended to add smart contracts to Bitcoin. An application of [Chain Key cryptography](/how-it-works/chain-key-technology) gives each canister their own Bitcoin public key, thus directly integrating the Internet Computer blockchain with the Bitcoin network. In particular, smart contracts on the Internet Computer will be able to hold, send and receive their own Bitcoin.
