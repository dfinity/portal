# Peer-to-Peer

The peer-to-peer layer (P2P) of the Internet Computer realizes the reliable and secure communication of *network messages*, also called *artifacts*, between the nodes of a subnet.
Artifacts are the network messages that are to be broadcast in the subnet, such as ingress messages to canister smart contracts submitted by users or protocol-originating messages such as signature shares computed by the consensus layer of subnet nodes.
P2P realizes a peer-to-peer broadcast network that guarantees the secure eventual broadcast delivery of an artifact.
The P2P layer thereby is the communication fabric for the IC protocol stack and is used by the consensus layer, the next layer in the stack above it, to broadcast artifacts to the nodes in the subnet.

It is important to note that broadcast artifacts reach all subnet nodes eventually, that is, no upper bound on when this happens can be given.
This *asynchronous communication network* assumption is used for the ICP's communication and consensus layers as it reflects the properties of real-world networks.

## Gossip Protocol

The P2P layer builds upon the basic principle of *gossip*.
Gossip in communication networks works along the same basic principle as gossip among people: A node in the subnet is connected with a subset of the other nodes of the subnet – its *peers*.
Whenever a node receives a message from a peer or creates one itself as part of the IC protocol, it gossips this message to all its peers.
By every node in the network doing exactly this, every artifact *eventually* propagates through the whole subnet.

## Adverts

Whenever a subnet node receives or generates an artifact to be broadcast, the node makes the artifact available to all peers.
Every node doing so ensures that the artifact will eventually be delivered to all subnet nodes.
However, doing so in a naïve way by simply forwarding the message to all peers would result in nodes receiving as many copies of the same message as the node has peers, which unnecessarily consumes networking bandwidth for transmitting duplicate messages and reduces the achieveable throughput of the subnet.

This duplication of delivered artifacts in the naïve approach is mitigated by nodes sending *adverts* for artifacts to their peers instead of sending the artifacts themselves.
An advert specifies its corresponding artifact, but is a small message only containing the hash of the artifact to unambiguously refer to it and some additional metadata.
A node only pushes adverts for artifacts to its peers.
After receiving an advert, a node may request the corresponding artifact from one or more of its peers who sent it an advert for that artifact.

## Prioritization of Artifacts

The P2P layer allows the prioritization of artifacts such that the more crucial artifacts are broadcast throughout the subnet nodes more quickly than the others.
Prioritizing some artifacts over others is important to ensure that the protocol can always make progress and not be starved of network bandwidth for "less important" traffic.
This principle is well known from traditional networking and applies equally well to a blockchain system.

## Implementation Architecture

The P2P layer's implementation architecture uses the concept of *artifact pools* for nodes to keep track of received and to-be-broadcast artifacts.
An artifact pool has a *validated* and an *unvalidated* section, containing artifacts that have been validated by the upper protocol layer of the node or generated on the node, or containing artifacts that are still unvalidated, respectively.
Different pools are used for different kinds of artifacts.
Whenever the P2P layer receives an artifact from another node, it becomes part of an unvalidated pool.
P2P then requests its validation from components in a higher protocol layer, and once validated, the artifact is moved to the validated pool for this kind of artifact.
Artifacts generated by the protocol on the node are immediately placed into a validated pool, as being generated by the protocol locally makes them implicitly validated.

The implementation uses *adverts queues* to track received adverts, a *requested queue* to track which artifacts are currently being downloaded from peers, and a *receive check* data structure that tracks which artifacts have been downloaded already.
Those data structures help realize an efficient advert-based gossip protocol supporting artifact priorities.

Each node maintains multiple parallel open connections to each of its peers to better utilize the available network bandwidth.

The architecture and implementation of the P2P layer is designed for high throughput and fairness between higher-layer protocol components, e.g., by using parallel data streams between peers to download artifacts, bandwidth management for connections, and prioritization to favour more important artifacts over less important ones.
Good throughput is valued higher than low latency, as it is crucial for obtaining a system that will be able to rival public cloud in the future.
