Applications are deployed in the form of canister smart contracts: bundles of WebAssembly bytecode logic, created from any high-level programming language such as Rust or Motoko, and the memory pages that the code runs inside. A key breakthrough is that the Internet Computer can host any number of canisters, and therefore any amount of data, fully on-chain.

Since those networks use ECDSA, a canister must be able to create ECDSA signatures.

      "<p>Are you a bot or a person? That is difficult to ascertain from across the Internet – but often essential. For instance, social media platforms provide more meaningful interactions if content is provided by real humans, decentralized governance processes benefit from power being distributed more evenly across many voters, and the bootstrapping of token economies becomes fairer if tokens can be distributed evenly to individuals. All of the above are highly relevant for the IC, which hosts multiple social networks, provides decentralized governance processes, and allows for the tokenization of the dapp services that run on it. But the IC is not only a beneficiary of thwarting bots - it can also provide the solution!</p>\n<p>Virtual people parties, coordinated by the Internet Computer, establish the personhood of otherwise pseudonymous identities. In a virtual people party, a small group of users validate each others’ personhood in a process that is fast, easy, and anonymous! For the time of the party, users provide a deposit of 1 ICP which can be withdrawn after the party is complete. During the party, which only takes a few minutes, users are divided into small groups and meet in a special video-chat application on mobile phones. But, unlike a typical video call, users do not show their faces or reveal their identity. Instead, users prove their personhood by directing the camera at the environment and reacting appropriately with camera movements to the requests of other users. At the same time, the video stream of the environment serves to validate the user’s location. This ensures that no user can participate in multiple groups simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Users that are validated as persons in a people party obtain increased voting power in the governance system. This improves the democratization of the Internet Computer&#39;s governance system by assigning more weight to individual persons. The increased voting rewards also encourage users to participate in the people parties.</p>\n",

      "ICEVM – Towards an Ethereum Virtual Machine on the Internet Computer",
    speaker: "Dieter Sommer ",
    speakerTitle: "Senior Technical Program Manager",
    description:
      "<p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has been the first and is still the world&#39;s most-widely-used smart contract execution environment. The EVM features synchronous smart contract call semantics which simplifies certain aspects of smart contract implementation, but greatly impedes scalability. Currently, the EVM is the environment of choice of most DeFi dApps and therefore EVM-compatible chains can benefit from network effects resulting from easily-portable DeFi smart contracts, a large tooling ecosystem and developer community and still the largest user community.\nIn this talk we shed some light onto what it would take to make the Internet Computer EVM compatible. We particularly consider the option of running an EVM as a smart contract on the Internet Computer. The major challenges of bringing the EVM to the Internet Computer result from the impedance mismatch between the asynchronous messaging model of the Internet Computer and the synchronous smart contract call semantics of the EVM. We present limitations of EVM architectures on the Internet Computer and potential solutions to the main challenges. This talk is intended as a starting point of a wider (technical) discussion on how to best bring an EVM to the Internet Computer.</p>\n",
