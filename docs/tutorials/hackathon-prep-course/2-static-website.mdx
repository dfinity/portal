# 2: Creating a static website

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

To compile frontend assets like CSS and JavaScript into a Wasm module that can be deployed on ICP as a canister, `dfx` uses Rust boilerplate code to create an **asset canister**.

Canister smart contracts are able to serve HTTP content natively, allowing for dapp frontends to be served directly in a web browser using the canister's URL at `http://<canister id>.icp0.io` and `http://<canister id>.raw.icp0.io`. Frontend canisters can be used to deliver HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages and answer API requests.

If a canister wants to serve HTTP content, it should implement a method that consumes an HTTP request, which contains a URL, HTTP method, and headers, then outputs an HTTP response that contains a status, headers, and the response body. The canister method can return HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content as part of the HTTP response.

:::info
The terms 'asset canister' and 'frontend canister' are sometimes used interchangeably. **Asset** canister is typically used to describe the Rust code `dfx` uses in the background to compile a project's frontend assets into Wasm. **Frontend** canister is typically used as a general term to describe a project's frontend.
:::

Applications deployed on ICP can have frontends that:

- Are deployed on ICP and communicate with backend canister(s) to create a fully onchain dapp.

- Are hosted externally (off-chain) and communicate with backend canister(s) deployed on ICP.

- Only provide web assets and do not communicate with a backend canister.

In the previous tutorial, you deployed a project with a single backend canister, then interacted with that canister through the Candid API interface. In this tutorial, let's explore how a canister can host a static website that does not interact with a backend canister and is used only to serve web assets.

## Crypto blog example

[Open the ICP Ninja My Crypto Blog project](https://icp.ninja/s/GQVBz). [View the ICP Ninja demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19d8TrhWWQk) for more details about using the platform.

Let's review the project's file structure:

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend     # Folder containing the asset files for your dapp's frontend.
‚îÇ ¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  public
|   ‚îÇ ¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico
‚îÇ ¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  src
|   ‚îÇ ¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.jsx # Source code for a simple React application.
‚îÇ ¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  index.css
‚îÇ ¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  index.html
‚îÇ ¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  package.json
‚îÇ ¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  postcss.config.js
‚îÇ ¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  tailwind.config.js
‚îÇ ¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  vite.config.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dfx.json ¬† ¬† # The configuration file for your Internet Computer dapp.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md    # Information about the project and using ICP Ninja.
```

### dfx.json‚Äã

The `dfx.json` file for this project will closely resemble the one used for the [Hello, world!](./1-hello-world.mdx) example, however there is one key difference. Rather than defining the canister is `"type": "motoko"`, this project will define the canister as `"type": "asset"` which prompts `dfx` to compile the canister's assets into a Wasm module using Rust boilerplate code.

```json title=dfx.json
{
  "canisters": {
    "frontend": {
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "frontend/index.html"
      },
      "source": ["frontend/dist"],
      "type": "assets"
    }
  }
}
```

### `frontend/src/main.jsx`

This project's `main.jsx` file defines the source code for a simple app using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS that the canister will host. This app will create a very basic blog website with three randomly generated placeholder blog post entries.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import '../index.css';

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
      }
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-500">
      <div className="w-96 rounded-lg bg-white p-8 shadow-lg">
        <h1 className="mb-4 text-center text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">üöÄ My Crypto Blog üöÄ</h1>
        <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
          A simple web page hosted onchain on ICP. Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
          You can host any kind of frontend application, including React, Vue, Svelte, and more on ICP!
        </p>
        <div className="mt-6 flex justify-center">
          <button onClick={fetchData} className="rounded bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 font-bold text-white hover:bg-blue-700">
            Fetch Posts
          </button>
        </div>
        {isLoading && <p className="mt-4 text-center text-gray-600">Loading...</p>}
        {error && <p className="mt-4 text-center text-red-500">Error: {error}</p>}
        {data && (
          <div className="mt-4">
            {data.slice(0, 3).map(
              (
                post // Display only first 3 posts for brevity
              ) => (
                <div key={post.id} className="mb-2 rounded bg-gray-100 p-2">
                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{post.title}</h3>
                  <p className="text-sm">{post.body.slice(0, 100)}...</p>
                </div>
              )
            )}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Deploy the canister

Click the "Deploy" button in the upper right corner of the code editor. ICP Ninja will deploy the project and return the canister's URL:

```
‚Üí Reserving canisters onchain
‚Üí Building frontend
‚Üí Uploading frontend assets
ü•∑üöÄüéâ Your dapp's Internet Computer URL is ready:
https://rueiq-3qaaa-aaaab-qbk7q-cai.icp1.io
‚è∞ Your dapp will be available for 20 minutes
```

Open the dapp's "Internet Computer URL" in your web browser. This will open the React application, which will include a button you can click to generate the three random blog posts.

<div class="text--center">
¬† <img
¬† ¬† src={useBaseUrl("/img/docs/my-crypto-blog.png")}
¬† ¬† alt="Application architecture"
¬† ¬† width="800"
¬† />
</div>

To edit the website's content, make adjustments to either the `main.jsx` file or change the styling in the `index.css` file. For example, you can change the page's title, body text, button functionality, or add photos and videos to be embedded on the page.

Since this is a static website, however, if you'd like to add any backend functionality such as user authentication and profiles, saving data to a user's account, or uploading and editing data, you will need to add a backend canister to your project. This will be demonstrated in the next tutorial module.
