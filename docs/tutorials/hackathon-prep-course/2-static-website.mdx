# 2: Creating a static website

To get started building on ICP, there are several sample projects and boilerplate templates available for you to use. In this tutorial, you'll use an example project within [ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja), a web-based IDE that includes all the tools necessary to create and deploy a project directly from your web browser. It doesn't require downloading the IC SDK or obtaining cycles to get started.

## Your first full-stack app

Projects on ICP have a default architecture of two canisters:

- A frontend canister: Hosts the user interface and assets such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript, or React elements.

- A backend canister: Hosts the application's primary source code and functionality. Backend source code is written in languages like Motoko, Rust, TypeScript, Python, or C++.

## Hello, world!

To demonstrate a simple fullstack dapp that

This tutorial will use the Motoko ["Hello, world!" example](https://icp.ninja/projects/hello-world) on ICP Ninja. Once you have opened the example in ICP Ninja, you will see the project's files in the file manager window on the left of the screen.



Let's review the project's file structure:

```bash
├── backend      # Folder containing the source code of your dapp's backend.
│   ├──  app.mo  # The default source code file.
├── frontend     # Folder containing the asset files for your dapp's frontend.
│   ├──  index.html   # Entrypoint file for the frontend.
│   ├──  package.json
│   ├──  vite.config.js
├── dfx.json     # The configuration file for your Internet Computer dapp.
├── mops.toml    # Package configuration file for Motoko.
├── README.md    # Information about the project and using ICP Ninja.
```

### dfx.json​

The `dfx.json` file in the root directory defines the canisters that make up the application and where their source code is located. This project uses the following `dfx.json` file:

```json title=dfx.json
{
  "canisters": {
    "backend": {
      "main": "backend/app.mo", # Defines the backend canister's source code file
      "type": "motoko",   # Defines the type of canister
      "args": "--enhanced-orthogonal-persistence"
    },
    "frontend": {
      "dependencies": ["backend"], # Defines a dependency of the backend canister
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "frontend/index.html" # Defines the file that should be opened by default for the frontend
      },
      "source": ["frontend/dist"],
      "type": "assets"
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env",
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "packtool": "mops sources"
    }
  }
}
```
