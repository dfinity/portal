# 2: Creating a static website

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

Canister smart contracts are able to serve HTTP content natively, allowing for dapp frontends to be served directly in a web browser using the canister's URL at `http://<canister id>.icp0.io` and `http://<canister id>.raw.icp0.io`. Frontend canisters can be used to deliver HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages and answer API requests.

If a canister wants to serve HTTP content, it should implement a method that consumes an HTTP request, which contains a URL, HTTP method, and headers, then outputs an HTTP response that contains a status, headers, and the response body. The canister method can return HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content as part of the HTTP response.

To compile frontend assets like CSS and JavaScript into a Wasm module that can be deployed to ICP as a canister, `dfx` uses Rust boilerplate code to create an **asset canister**.

:::info
The terms 'asset canister' and 'frontend canister' are sometimes used interchangeably. **Asset** canister is typically used to describe the Rust code `dfx` uses in the background to compile a project's frontend assets into Wasm. **Frontend** canister is typically used as a general term to describe a project's frontend.
:::

Applications deployed on ICP can have frontends that:

- Are deployed on ICP and communicate with backend canister(s) to create a fully onchain dapp.

- Are hosted externally (off-chain) and communicate with backend canister(s) deployed on ICP.

- Only provide web assets and do not communicate with a backend canister.

In the previous tutorial, you deployed a project with a single backend canister and then interacted with that canister through the Candid API interface. In this tutorial, let's explore how a canister can host a static website that does not interact with a backend canister and is used only to serve web assets.

## Crypto blog example

Open the [ICP Ninja 'My Crypto Blog' project](https://icp.ninja/s/GQVBz). View the [ICP Ninja demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19d8TrhWWQk) for more details about using the platform.

Let's review the project's file structure:

```bash
├── frontend     # Folder containing the asset files for your dapp's frontend.
│   ├──  public
|   │   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├──  src
|   │   ├── main.jsx # Source code for a simple React application.
│   ├──  index.css
│   ├──  index.html
│   ├──  package.json
│   ├──  postcss.config.js
│   ├──  tailwind.config.js
│   ├──  vite.config.js
├── dfx.json     # The configuration file for your Internet Computer dapp.
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md    # Information about the project and using ICP Ninja.
```

### `dfx.json​`

The `dfx.json` file for this project will closely resemble the one used for the [Hello, world!](./1-hello-world.mdx) example; however there is one key difference. Rather than defining what the canister is `"type": "motoko"`, this project will define the canister as `"type": "asset"` which prompts `dfx` to compile the canister's assets into a Wasm module using Rust boilerplate code.

```json title=dfx.json file=../../references/samples/hosting/my_crypto_blog/dfx.json
```

### `frontend/src/main.jsx`

This project's `main.jsx` file defines the source code for a simple app using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS that the canister will host. This app will create a very basic blog website with three randomly generated placeholder blog post entries.

```jsx title=main.jsx file=../../references/samples/hosting/my_crypto_blog/frontend/src/main.jsx
```

## Deploying the canister

Click the "Deploy" button in the upper right corner of the code editor. ICP Ninja will deploy the project and return the canister's URL:

```
→ Reserving canisters onchain
→ Building frontend
→ Uploading frontend assets
🥷🚀🎉 Your dapp's Internet Computer URL is ready:
https://rueiq-3qaaa-aaaab-qbk7q-cai.icp1.io
⏰ Your dapp will be available for 20 minutes
```

Open the dapp's "Internet Computer URL" in your web browser. This will open the React application, which will include a button you can click to generate the three random blog posts.

<div class="text--center">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/docs/my-crypto-blog.png")}
    alt="My Crypto Blog"
    width="800"
  />
</div>

To edit the website's content, make adjustments to either the `main.jsx` file or change the styling in the `index.css` file. For example, you can change the page's title, body text, or button functionality, or add photos and videos to be embedded on the page.

Since this is a static website, however, if you'd like to add any backend functionality such as user authentication and profiles, saving data to a user's account, or uploading and editing data, you will need to add a backend canister to your project.
