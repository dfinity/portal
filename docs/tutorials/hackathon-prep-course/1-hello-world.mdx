# 1: Hello, world!

The Internet Computer (ICP) is a transparent and secure blockchain network that enables developers to create and deploy fully decentralized applications (dapps). Dapps are created by deploying specialized smart contracts known as **canisters**. A canister is capable of hosting entire applications, including their source code and user interface. Once a canister is deployed to the mainnet, it is publicly accessible and upgradable. Users can interact with dapps directly in their web browser without needing a crypto wallet.

## Deploy your first canister smart contract

To begin developing applications on ICP, the tool [ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja) provides a browser-based development environment that can be accessed from anywhere using any device. It is a free platform that doesn't require you to [download tools](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install), create or authenticate with an [identity](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/identities), or obtain [cycles](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/tokens-and-cycles).

ICP Ninja does, however, impose a few [restrictions](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/icp-ninja) that should be noted when using it. It is not designed to develop and deploy applications for long-term, production use.

### Application architecture

Applications deployed on ICP are composed of one or more canisters. Each canister contains code in the form of a WebAssembly (Wasm) module and state, i.e., the data stored in the canister.

When you design a dapp to be deployed on ICP, one of the first decisions you will make is how your dapp should be structured. Dapps can consist of a single canister, such as only the backend canister; they can consist of a single backend canister and a single frontend canister, or they can consist of several canisters.

Typically, service-based dapps that don't include a frontend UI work well as single canister projects, while projects that involve several reusable services can work well as multi-canister projects.

The default project architecture has two canisters:

- **Backend canister**: Used to store the application’s data and to provide endpoints to access and modify the data. Backend canisters can be written in [a variety of different languages](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/cdks/) (Motoko, Rust, TypeScript, and more).

- **Frontend canister**: Used to store the web assets for the application’s user interface.

## Hello, world! backend

Let's start with deploying only a backend canister. Open the [ICP Ninja "Hello, world!" project](https://icp.ninja/s/w2MbP). View the [ICP Ninja demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19d8TrhWWQk) for more details about using the platform.

This project will contain the following files:

```bash
├── backend      # Folder containing the source code of your dapp's backend.
│   ├──  app.mo  # The default source code file; this is the file you'll be working with in this tutorial.
├── dfx.json     # The configuration file for your application.
├── mops.toml    # Package configuration file for Motoko.
├── README.md    # Information about the project and using ICP Ninja.
```

### `dfx.json​`

The `dfx.json` file defines the application's canister and its source code file. This project uses the following `dfx.json` file:

```json title="dfx.json" file=../../references/samples/motoko/backend_only/dfx.json
```

Learn more about [dfx.json](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx-json).

### `backend/app.mo`

Now, let's review the `backend/app.mo` file to learn about the application's functions.

```motoko title="backend/app.mo" no-repl file=../../references/samples/motoko/backend_only/backend/app.mo
```

- First, an actor is defined and named `HelloWorld`. An actor is an object that can hold state and interact with the world through messages.
- Then, a **query method** is defined. Query methods do not alter the canister's state or data. They can be thought of as 'read-only' operations. When called, this query method will return the text "Hello, " followed by the text passed to the method and an exclamation mark.

## Types of canister calls

When calls are made to a canister's methods, there are two primary types: calls that go through consensus and calls that do not go through consensus.

Calls that go through consensus are able to alter the canister's state. These are referred to as **update calls**. Any changes made with an update call are persisted. They are executed on all nodes of a subnet since the result must go through the subnet's consensus process. Update calls are submitted and answered asynchronously since they must go through consensus. Update calls are not defined with a function modifier as query calls are. Below is a simple update call example that provides a method for counting the number of characters within a given string, then updates the canister's state. If the string is divisible by 2, the function returns a value of 'true.'

Calls that do not go through consensus do not alter the state of a canister, making them 'read-only' operations. They are referred to as **query calls**. Query calls are used to query the current state of a canister or make a call to a method that operates on the canister's state. They are executed synchronously and answered immediately once received. Query calls are executed on a single node within a subnet. Query methods can be called in replicated mode as update calls. The backend canister in this example uses the following query call, defined by the keyword `query` as seen above:

Additionally, there are several other terms regarding calls that you will come across as an ICP developer, such as:

**Composite queries** are query calls that can call other queries (on the same subnet). They can only be invoked via ingress messages using `dfx` or through an agent such as a browser front-end, and not by other canisters.

**Certified variables** are verifiable pieces of data that have an associated certificate that proves the data's authenticity. Certified variables are set using an update call, then read using a query call.

**Inter-canister calls** are used to make calls between different canisters.

## Deploying the canister

Click the "Deploy" button in the upper right corner of the code editor. ICP Ninja will deploy the project and return the canister's URL:

```
Deploying code onchain...
→ Reserving canisters onchain
→ Building backend
Backend Internet Computer URL:
https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.icp1.io/?id=6kwk6-qqaaa-aaaab-qbmga-cai
⏰ Your dapp will be available for 20 minutes
```

Open the "Backend Internet Computer URL" in your web browser. This will open a [Candid API](/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/candid/candid-concepts) interface you can use to call the method `greet` defined in the backend.

In the input box, insert "ICP," then select "Query." The backend canister will process the call and return the response defined in the method. Since the method is defined as a `query` method, the canister simply returns data; it does not alter the canister's state.

```
("Hello, ICP!")
```

You can edit the `app.mo` file to return a different greeting, such as:

```motoko no-repl
return "Hello, " # name # "! This is my first canister on ICP!";
```

Then click "Redeploy" to [upgrade](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-2/2.1-storage-persistence#upgrading-canisters) your canister's code. Once deployed, you can test the `greet` method in the Candid API, and it should return your new greeting.
