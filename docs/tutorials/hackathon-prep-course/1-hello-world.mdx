# 1: Hello, world!

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

The Internet Computer (ICP) is a transparent and secure blockchain network that enables developers to create and deploy fully decentralized applications. Decentralized applications are created through deploying smart contracts, which are known as **canisters**. A canister is capable of hosting entire applications, including their source and user interfaces. Once canisters are deployed to the mainnet, they are publicly accessible and upgradable.

Developers can build anything using ICP's advanced smart contract capabilities without using traditional IT infrastructure. Users can interact with decentralized applications deployed on ICP directly in their web browser without needing a crypto wallet.

## Deploy your first canister smart contract

To begin developing and deploying applications on ICP, the web IDE [ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja) provides a browser-based development environment that can be accessed from anywhere using any device. It is a free tool that doesn't require you to [download tools](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install), create or authenticate with an [identity](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/identities), or obtain [cycles](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/tokens-and-cycles).

ICP Ninja does, however, impose a few [restrictions](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/icp-ninja) that should be noted when using it. It is not designed to develop and deploy applications for long-term, production use.

### Application architecture

Applications deployed on ICP are composed of one or more canisters. Each canister contains code in the form of a WebAssembly (Wasm) module and state, i.e., the data stored in the canister.

The default project architecture has two canisters:

- **Backend canister**: Used to store the application’s data and to provide endpoints to access and modify the data. Backend canisters can be written in [a variety of different languages](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/cdks/) (Motoko, Rust, TypeScript, and more).

- **Frontend canister**: Stores the web assets for the application’s user interface and interacts with the backend.

### Hello, world! backend only

Let's start with deploying only a backend canister. [Open the ICP Ninja project](https://icp.ninja/s/w2MbP).

It will contain the following files:

```bash
├── backend      # Folder containing the source code of your dapp's backend.
│   ├──  app.mo  # The default source code file; this is the file you'll be working with in this tutorial.
├── dfx.json     # The configuration file for your application.
├── mops.toml    # Package configuration file for Motoko.
├── README.md    # Information about the project and using ICP Ninja.
```

### dfx.json​

The `dfx.json` file defines the application's canisters and their source code files. This project uses the following `dfx.json` file:

```json title=dfx.json
{
  "canisters": {
    "backend": {
      "main": "backend/app.mo",
      "type": "motoko",
      "args": "--enhanced-orthogonal-persistence"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "packtool": "mops sources"
    }
  }
}

```

Learn more about [dfx.json](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx-json).

### `app.mo`

Now, let's review the `backend/app.mo` file to learn about the application's functions.

```motoko title="backend/app.mo" no-repl
// First define an actor named HelloWorld.
// An actor is an object that can hold state and interact with the world through messages.
persistent actor HelloWorld {
  // Query methods do not alter the canister's state or data. They can be thought of as 'ready-only' operations.
  // This query method will return the text "Hello, " followed by the text passed to the method.
  public query func greet(name : Text) : async Text {
    // The method’s body returns Text concatenating 'Hello ,' the input value 'name', and an exclamation mark.
    return "Hello, " # name # "!";
  };
};
```

### Deploy the canister

Click the "Deploy" button in the upper right corner of the code editor. ICP Ninja will deploy the project and return the canister's URLs:

```
Deploying code onchain...
→ Reserving canisters onchain
→ Building backend
Backend Internet Computer URL:
https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.icp1.io/?id=6kwk6-qqaaa-aaaab-qbmga-cai
⏰ Your dapp will be available for 20 minutes
```

Open the "Backend Internet Computer URL" in your web browser. This will open a [Candid API](/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/candid/candid-concepts) interface you can use to call the method `greet` defined in the backend.

In the input box, insert "ICP," then select the "Query". The backend canister will process the call and return the response defined in the method. Since the method is defined as a `query` method, the canister simply returns data to the caller; it does not alter the canister's state.

```
("Hello, ICP!")
```

You can edit the `app.mo` file to return a different greeting, such as:

```
return "Hello, " # name # "! This is my first canister on ICP!";
```

Then click "Deploy" again to upgrade your canister's code. Once deployed, you can test the `greet` method in the Candid API and it should return your new greeting.
