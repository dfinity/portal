# 3.3 Canister snapshots

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

A canister is managed by controllers, which can be:

- A single developer identity.

- Multiple developer identities.

- Another canister.


One method of recovery is rolling the canister back to a previously saved snapshot (if one exists).

## What are canister snapshots?

A canister contains compiled Wasm code and data such as the canister ID, settings, and Wasm memory. If a canister stops functioning, traps, or needs to be restored to a previous state, developers can use canister snapshots. Snapshots save the current:

- Stable memory.
- Heap memory.
- Wasm module.
- Canister metadata.

Snapshots can only be taken when a canister is stopped, and only controllers are permitted to create, load, or delete snapshots. If a canister has no controller and no access to the controller identities can be regained, there is no supported method to recover the canister.

## Creating a snapshot

To create a snapshot:

```bash
dfx canister stop <canister-name>
dfx canister snapshot create <canister-name>
```

Only 10 snapshots can be stored per canister.

To create a snapshot on the mainnet, add `--network ic` to both commands.

To list existing snapshots:

```bash
dfx canister snapshot list <canister-name>
```

## Loading a snapshot

To restore a canister from a saved snapshot:

```bash
dfx canister stop <canister-name>
dfx canister snapshot load <canister-name> <snapshot-id>
```

This will overwrite the canisterâ€™s current code and data. Any changes made since the snapshot was taken will be lost.

## Deleting a snapshot

To delete a snapshot:

```bash
dfx canister snapshot delete <canister-name> <snapshot-id>
```
