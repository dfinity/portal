# Welcome to the ICP Developer Liftoff

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Tutorial"]} />

Are you ready to get started developing on the [Internet Computer](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/33152818663444-What-is-ICP), but not sure where to begin?

The Developer Liftoff is designed to give both new and existing developers a clear learning path to develop on the Internet Computer. Starting at level 0 with an introduction to the Internet Computer, terminology, and setting up a developer environment, to level 5 that details building complex dapps, the Developer Liftoff contains essential information for developers of all skill levels.

This Developer Liftoff will focus on developing canisters and applications using Rust. In the future, there will be additional variations of the Developer Liftoff that focus on different developer paths, such as:

- Bitcoin-focused development.
- Ethereum-focused development.
