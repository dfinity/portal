In the past, blockchain networks were only able to communicate with external servers through blockchain oracles, or third-party entities that relayed calls from the blockchain to an external server, then routed the response back to the blockchain. This is because blockchains are a form of replicated state machine, where each replica must perform the same computations within the same state to make the same transitions each round. Since doing computations with results from an external source may lead to a state divergence, tools like oracles have been used in the past. However, on the Internet Computer, canisters can communicate directly with external servers or other blockchains through **HTTPS outcalls**.

HTTPS outcalls are a feature of canisters on ICP that allow smart contracts to directly make calls to HTTP servers that are external to ICP. The response of these HTTP calls can then be used by the smart contract in a way that the replica can safely be updated using the response without the risk of a state divergence.

:::info
This guide uses the term **HTTPS** to refer to both the **HTTP** and **HTTPS** protocols. This is because typically all traffic on a public network uses the secure HTTPS protocol.
:::

HTTPS outcalls provide the ability for different use cases and have several advantages compared to using oracles to handle external requests. Some of these are HTTPS outcalls use a stronger trust model since there are no external intermediaries, such as an oracle, required for the canister to communicate with external servers, and using HTTPS outcalls for communicating with external servers makes using canisters feel much closer to a "traditional" programming workflow that may not use blockchains or oracles. Most real-world dapps have a need for accessing data stored in off-chain entities, since most digital data is still stored in traditional, 'Web 2', services.

## Supported HTTP methods

Currently, HTTPS outcalls support `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` methods for HTTP requests. In this guide, you'll look at examples for `GET` and `POST` methods.

## Cycles

Cycles used to pay for an HTTP call must be explicitly transferred with the call. They will not be automatically deducted from the caller's balance.

## HTTPS outcalls API

A canister can make an HTTPS outcall by using the `http_request` method. This method uses the following parameters:

- `url`: Specifies the requested URL; must be valid per the standard [RFC-3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt). The length must not exceed `8192` and may include a custom port number.

- `max_response_bytes`: Specifies the maximum size of the request in bytes and must not exceed 2MB. This field is optional; if this field is not specified, the maximum of 2MB will be used.

:::info
It is recommended to set `max_response_bytes`, since using it appropriately can save developers a significant amount of cycles.
:::

- `method`: Specifies the method; currently, only `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` are supported.

- `headers`: Specifies the list of HTTP request headers and their corresponding values.

- `body`: Specifies the content of the request's body. This field is optional.

- `transform`: Specifies a function that transforms raw responses to sanitized responses, and a byte-encoded context that is provided to the function upon invocation, along with the response to be sanitized. This field is optional; if it is provided, the calling canister itself must export this function.

The returned response, including the response to the `transform` function if specified, will contain the following content:

- `status`: Specifies the response status (e.g., 200, 404).

- `headers`: Specifies the list of HTTP response headers and their corresponding values.

- `body`: Specifies the response's body.

### IPv6

When deploying applications to the Internet Computers, HTTPS outcalls can **only** be made to APIs that support **IPv6**. You can check if an API supports IPv6 by using a tool such as `https://ready.chair6.net/`.

## HTTP GET

To demonstrate how to use the HTTP `GET` outcall, you'll create a simple canister that has one public method named `get_icp_usd_exchange()`. This method will trigger an HTTP `GET` request to the external service Coinbase, which will return current data on the exchange rate between USD and ICP. This canister will have no frontend, and you will interact with its public methods via the Candid web UI.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [0.3: Developer environment setup](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-0/dev-env).

### Creating a new project

To get started, create a new project in your working directory. Open a terminal window, navigate into your working directory (`developer_ladder`), then use the following commands to start `dfx` and create a new project:

```
dfx start --clean --background
dfx new https_get
```

You will be prompted to select the language that your backend canister will use. Select 'Motoko':

```
? Select a backend language: ›
❯ Motoko
  Rust
  TypeScript (Azle)
  Python (Kybra)
```

:::info
`dfx` versions `v0.17.0` and newer support this `dfx new` interactive prompt. [Learn more about `dfx v0.17.0`](/blog/2024/02/14/news-and-updates/update#dfx-v0170).
:::

Then, select a frontend framework for your frontend canister. Select 'None':

```
  ? Select a frontend framework: ›
  SvelteKit
  React
  Vue
  Vanilla JS
  No JS template
❯ None
```

Lastly, you can include extra features to be added to your project:

```
  ? Add extra features (space to select, enter to confirm) ›
⬚ Internet Identity
⬚ Bitcoin (Regtest)
⬚ Frontend tests
```

Then, navigate into the new project directory:

```
cd https_get
```

### Creating an HTTP `GET` request

Then, open the `src/https_get_backend/main.mo` file in your code editor and replace the existing content with:

```motoko no-repl file=../../../references/samples/motoko/send_http_get/src/send_http_get_backend/main.mo#L1-L5
```

This piece of code imports the libraries that you'll be using. Each of these libraries is part of the Motoko base package, as indicated by 'mo:base'.

Now let's insert the code to define our actor. This actor will contain two functions; a function to transform the response that you'll receive from our `GET` response, and a function that sends our `GET` request. The code has been annotated with notes describing in detail what each piece does:

```motoko no-repl file=../../../references/samples/motoko/send_http_get/src/send_http_get_backend/main.mo#L8-L115
```

The code above is annotated with detailed notes and explanations. Take a moment to read through the code's content and annotations to fully understand the code's functionality.

A few important points to note are:

- `get_icp_usd_exchange()` is an update call. All methods that make HTTPS outcalls must be update calls because they go through consensus, even if the HTTPS outcall is a `GET`.

- The code above adds `230_949_972_000` cycles. This is typically enough for `GET` requests, but this may need to change depending on your use case.

### The `transform` function

The `transform` function in the code above is important because it takes the raw content and transforms it into a raw HTTP payload. This step sets the payload's headers, which include the Content Security Policy and Strict Transport Security headers.

When developing locally, this function doesn't have much of an effect since only the local replica (one node) is making the call.

When HTTP calls are used on the mainnet, a common error message may appear that indicates not all replicas on the subnet get the same response:

```
Reject text: Canister http responses were different across replicas, and no consensus was reached
```

This error occurs when the replicas on the subnet don't all return the same value for a piece of data within the HTTP response. For example, if you have an application that sends an HTTP request to the Coinbase API for the current price of a token, due to latency the replicas will not all return the same response. To remedy this, you can request the token price for a specific timestamp to assure that the replicas all return the same response.

Once you've inserted these snippets of code into the `src/https_get_backend/main.mo` file, save the file. The file should look like this:

```motoko no-repl file=../../../references/samples/motoko/send_http_get/src/send_http_get_backend/main.mo
```

Now, you can deploy the canister locally with the commands:

```bash
dfx start --clean --background
dfx deploy
```

:::caution
Recall that if you'd like to deploy this canister on the mainnet, you can use the `--network ic` flag.
:::

These commands should return the canister's URL. Open the `http_get_backend` canister's URL to open the Candid UI:

```bash
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    http_get_backend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=a3shf-5eaaa-aaaaa-qaafa-cai&id=avqkn-guaaa-aaaaa-qaaea-cai
```

### Calling the HTTP `GET` request

Once you open the Candid UI, you can use the 'Call' button to call the `get_icp_usd_exchange()` method, which sends an HTTP `GET` request. The result will be returned in the UI, such as:

![HTTP GET](../_attachments/http_get_candid.png)

You can play with a version of this canister running onchain: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=fm664-jyaaa-aaaap-qbomq-cai

## HTTP `POST`

To demonstrate how to use the HTTP `POST` outcall, you'll create a simple canister that has one public method named `send_http_post_request()`. This method will trigger an HTTP `POST` request to a public API service where the HTTP request can be inspected and you can inspect the request's headers and body to validate that it reflects what the canister sent.

The following are some important notes on `POST` requests:

- Since HTTPS outcalls go through consensus, it is expected that any HTTP `POST` request may be sent several times to its destination. This is because it is common for clients to retry requests for a variety of reasons.

- It is recommended that HTTP `POST` requests add the idempotency keys in the header of the request so that the destination knows which `POST` requests from the client are identical.

- Developers should be cautious using idempotency keys since the destination server may not know how to understand and use them.

### Creating a new project

For simplicity, you'll create a new project for our HTTP `POST` request. Navigate into your working directory and create another new project:

```bash
dfx new https_post
cd https_post
```

### Creating an HTTP `POST` request

Then, open the `src/https_post_backend/main.mo` file in your code editor and replace the existing content with:

```motoko no-repl file=../../../references/samples/motoko/send_http_get/src/send_http_get_backend/main.mo#L1-L4
```

Now, you'll define an actor using that contain two functions; a function to transform the response that you'll receive from our `POST` response, and a function that sends our `POST` request. The code has been annotated with notes describing in detail what each piece does:

```motoko no-repl file=../../../references/samples/motoko/send_http_get/src/send_http_get_backend/main.mo#L6-L106
```

:::info
The `transform` function in this HTTP `POST` request should be used in the same manner that it was in the HTTP `GET` example. You can revisit the [transform function](#the-transform-function) description above for more information.
