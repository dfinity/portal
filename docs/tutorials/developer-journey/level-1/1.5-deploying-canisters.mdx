## Overview

Now that you have some cycles to pay for your canister's resources, you can deploy your dapp on the mainnet. When a canister is deployed to the mainnet, it's code will be hosted on the nodes that make up one of the mainnet's subnets. The canister will be hosted on these nodes until it is manually uninstalled by the developer, or until it runs out of cycles and is uninstalled automatically.

Once a dapp is deployed on the mainnet, it can be accessed from the canister's public URL by end-users and can communicate with other canisters that are deployed on the mainnet.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [0.3 Developer environment setup](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-0/dev-env).

You will be building off of the previous two modules, [1.3 Developing your first dapp](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.3-first-dapp) and [1.4 Acquiring and using cycles](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.4-using-cycles). You will need to have followed along and completed the steps outlined in these modules to complete this tutorial.

## Deploying to the mainnet

To deploy your dapp to the mainnet, first assure that your terminal window is open and you've navigated into the directory of your `poll` dapp that you created in module [1.3 Developing your first dapp](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.3-first-dapp).

Then, assure that all necessary packages are installed for the project's frontend with the command:

```bash
npm install
```

Now it's time to register, build, and deploy your dapp. First, let's check to make sure you have an active connection to the mainnet. Run the command:

```bash
dfx ping ic
```

A successful connection to the mainnet will return an output such as:

```
{
  "certified_height": 57374997  "ic_api_version": "0.18.0"  "impl_hash": "d5896681ceac74c83c9473654de75214d5079193294ade3775e89a81270fd0cf"  "impl_version": "f8f59f896499f2fef394d8321116f83351c59aa8"  "replica_health_status": "healthy"  "root_key": [48, 129, 130, 48, 29, 6, 13, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 97, 0, 129, 76, 14, 110, 199, 31, 171, 88, 59, 8, 189, 129, 55, 60, 37, 92, 60, 55, 27, 46, 132, 134, 60, 152, 164, 241, 224, 139, 116, 35, 93, 20, 251, 93, 156, 12, 213, 70, 217, 104, 95, 145, 58, 12, 11, 44, 197, 52, 21, 131, 191, 75, 67, 146, 228, 103, 219, 150, 214, 91, 155, 180, 203, 113, 113, 18, 248, 71, 46, 13, 90, 77, 20, 80, 95, 253, 116, 132, 176, 18, 145, 9, 28, 95, 135, 185, 136, 131, 70, 63, 152, 9, 26, 11, 170, 174]
}
```


Now, you can deploy your dapp to the mainnet by running the following command:

```bash
dfx deploy --network ic
```

In this command, the `--network` flag specifies which network the dapp should be deployed on. Other options for this flag are `--network local` and `--network playground`. This tutorial series covered these in module [1.1: exploring a live demo](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.1-live-demo).

Using the flag `--network ic` is required to deploy your dapp on the mainnet. If this flag is not included, your dapp will only be deployed locally by default.

This command doesn't include a canister name, meaning it will automatically deploy **all** canisters that are specified in the `dfx.json` file. You can specify a single canister to be deployed by including the canister's name in the command, such as:

```bash
dfx deploy poll_backend --network ic
```

You want to deploy both the `poll_backend` and `poll_frontend` canisters since they work together to create your poll dapp, so the `dfx deploy --network ic` command should be used for this tutorial.

The output of this command will include information about what actions are happening. For example, the output should resemble the following:

```bash
Deploying all canisters.

```

If you manually converted ICP tokens into cycles, and your cycles balance doesn't contain enough cycles to complete this deployment, you can convert more ICP into cycles with the command:


```bash
dfx cycles convert 1.005 --network ic
```

This command converts an additional 1.005 ICP tokens to cycles.

If you used the free cycles coupon, this step is not applicable.

Now, let's use your dapp! To access the dapp's frontend, first you need to get the canister's URL. To get this, run the command:

```bash
dfx canister id poll_frontend --network ic
```

This command will return the canister's URL, which should look like this:

```bash
https://5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai.icp0.io
```

If you open this URL in your web browser, you will see the same poll dapp frontend that you saw when you deployed it locally. The only difference is that now your dapp is hosted 100% on-chain, does not rely on your local <GlossaryTooltip>replica</GlossaryTooltip> to keep running, and you can send this URL to your friends and get them to vote on your poll!

## Next steps

Now that you have canisters running on the mainnet, the next steps are to learn how you can manage these canisters, such as how to upgrade them or delete them.
