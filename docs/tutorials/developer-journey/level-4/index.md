- [4.3 ckBTC and Bitcoin integration](4.3-ckbtc-and-bitcoin.md): One of the key features of the Internet Computer is known as **chain-key cryptography**. This feature enables integrations with other networks, such as the Bitcoin network. This tutorial takes a look at ckBTC and the Internet Computer's Bitcoin integration: 
    - Bitcoin integration architecture.
    - What is ckBTC?
    - Bitcoin use-cases on the IC.
    - Deploying a Bitcoin dapp.
        - Prerequisites.
        - Setting up a local Bitcoin network.
        - Cloning the `basic_bitcoin` example.
        - Deploying the example canister.
        - Generating a Bitcoin address.
        - Receiving BTC.
        - Checking your BTC balance.
        - Sending BTC.
    - Resources.

- [4.4 NNS governance and staking](4.4-nns-governance.md): The Network Nervous System (NNS) is the governing body of the Internet Computer. It is a decentralized autonomous organization that is hosted fully on-chain and is responsible for making protocol-level upgrades to the IC:
    - What is the NNS?
        - Neurons.
        - Proposals.
    - Why is the NNS important to developers?
    - Using the NNS dapp.
        - Transferring ICP tokens into your Internet Identity `Main` account.
        - Staking ICP in a neuron.
        - Interacting with NNS proposals.

- [4.5 Using quill](4.5-using-quill.md): Quill is a ledger and governance toolkit that provides support for self-custody of ICP tokens and functionality to interact with the NNS, SNSs, and ICP ledger from a **cold wallet**: 
    - What is quill?
    - Downloading and installing quill.
    - Using quill’s basic commands.
    - Using quill with ckBTC.
    - Using quill with the NNS.
    - Resources.

    - Mutable state.
        - Immutable variables versus mutable variables.
        - Reading data from mutable memory.
        - Immutable arrays.
        - Mutable arrays.
    - Local objects and classes.
        - Object classes versus actor classes.
        - Object types.
        - Object subtyping.
        - Object classes.
