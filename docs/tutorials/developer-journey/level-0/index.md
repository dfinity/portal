- [0.3: Developer environment setup](03-dev-env.md): Before we can begin our developer journey, we need to set up our developer environment. A developer environment is comprised of tools and packages that are required to develop code projects. This module covers:
    - Setting up a developer environment:
        - Confirming an internet connection.
        - Confirming access to a CLI.
            - Options for Windows users.
        - Downloading and installing the IC SDK.
        - Downloading and installing an IDE.
        - Downloading and installing git.
        - Downloading and installing Node.js.
        - Assuring all packages and tools are updated to latest version.

- [0.4: Introduction to canisters](04-intro-canisters.md): This page introduces canisters, their architecture, and discusses the different types of canisters that can be developed. This module covers:
    - Architecture:
        - Languages.
        - Actors.
        - Why is code compiled into WebAssembly?
    - Types of canisters:
        - Backend canisters.
        - Frontend canisters.
        - Custom canisters.
    - Using a single or multiple canister architecture.
    - Canister communication.
    - Canister controllers.
    - Cycles and resource charges.

- [0.5: Introduction to languages](05-intro-languages.md): In this page, we discuss the different languages that can be used to develop dapps, and provide a base-level introduction to the two primarily supported languages: Motoko and Rust. This module covers:
