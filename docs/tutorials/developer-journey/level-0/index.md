# Level 0: Pre-flight operations 

- [0.1: Overview of the Internet Computer](01-ic-overview.md): In order to understand how to develop dapps on the IC, the first step in the developer journey is to take a look at the architecture of the IC and how it functions. 
- [0.2: Internet Computer terminology](02-ic-terms.md): This page introduces some of the most commonly used terminology that developers should be aware of when building on the Internet Computer. 
- [0.3: Developer environment setup](03-dev-env.md): Before we can begin our developer journey, we need to set up our developer environment. A developer environment is comprised of tools and packages that are required to develop code projects.
- [0.4: Introduction to canisters](04-intro-canisters.md): This page introduces canisters, their architecture, and discusses the different types of canisters that can be developed. 
- [0.5: Introduction to languages](05-intro-languages.md): In this page, we discuss the different languages that can be used to develop dapps, and provide a base-level introduction to the two primarily supported languages: Motoko and Rust. 
- [0.6: Introduction to dfx](06-intro-dfx.md): `dfx` is the DFINITY command-line execution environment for the IC SDK. It is the primary tool used for creating, managing, and deploying dapps onto the Internet Computer.
