## Overview

As you've seen so far, **actors** are at the core functionality of canisters written in Motoko. In this tutorial, you'll explore actors further by taking a look at actor type definitions, how actors interact with async data, actor classes, and using multiple actors.

## Actor types

In the same way that objects have different object types, actors have different actor types. To demonstrate this, let's look at an example actor that defines a simple counter. This counter simply increments a value by `1`.

```motoko
actor Counter {

  var count = 0;

  public shared func inc() : async () { count += 1 };

  public shared func read() : async Nat { count };

  public shared func bump() : async Nat {
    count += 1;
    count;
  };
};
```

This actor declares three public functions and one field:

- The field `count` is mutable. It is initialized to zero and implicitly private.

- The function `inc()` asynchronously increments the value of `count`, then returns a type `async ()` for future synchronization.

- The function `read()` asynchronously reads the value of `count` and returns a type `async Nat`.

- The function `bump()` asynchronously increments and reads the `count` value; this returns a type `async Nat`.

### Actor type definition

This actor `Counter` has the following type:

```motoko no-repl
actor {
  inc  : shared () -> async ();
  read : shared () -> async Nat;
  bump : shared () -> async Nat;
}
```

In this definition, there are three 'members' of the actor which correlate to the three functions within the actor. Each of these functions have the modifier `shared`, which is defined in the actor type definition. Then, each member has the type that they return, such as `async ()` and `async Nat`.

In this type definition, you can see that each has the `shared` modifier for each member of the actor. Motoko allows you to omit this modifier when authoring an actor type, thus this can be simplified as:

```motoko no-repl
actor {
  inc  : () -> async ();
  read : () -> async Nat;
  bump : () -> async Nat;
}
```

## Shared functions

In the previous example, the only way to read or modify the `count` value in the Counter actor is through it's three `shared` functions. Shared functions are accessible through remote calls, meaning a user can submit a call to that function.

A **local function** will block the entity making a call to the function until the function has returned a result.

A **shared function** immediately returns a value known as a **future**. This future value indicates that an asynchronous value is expected to be returned, and can be represented in this tutorial as `f`. A call to `await f` will suspend any other computation in the origin of the call until `f` is complete. Once `f` is returned, the execution of the call's code resumes using the returned `f` result, which can be a value or an error.

A shared function's arguments and return value(s) must also be shared types. This is a subset of data types that includes shared function references, actor references, and immutable data, but does not include references to local functions or mutable data. Since interactions with actors are asynchronous, an actor's functions must return types in the form `async T`, where T is the data type.

In the previous example, you used `async Nat`. Currently, shared functions can only be declared in the body of an actor or actor class.

## Actors and async data

As you learned earlier, shared functions must be executed asynchronously and therefore must return data types in the form of `async Type`. When a call is made to a shared function, the `await` expression must be used to access the result of the returned async value.

To access the result of an async value, the receiver of the future use an `await` expression. For example, using the `Counter` actor you used previously, you can use the result of `Counter.read()` by binding the result value to an identifier (`a`), then await `a` to retrieve the `async Nat` return value, `n`:

```motoko no-repl
actor {
  let a : async Nat = Counter.read();
  let n : Nat = await a;
}
```

In this code, the following happens:

- First, the return value of `Counter.read()` is retrieved immediately; the code does not wait. Since the code does not wait, the value cannot be used as a `Nat` value yet.

- Then, the `Nat` value awaits the result of `a` and extracts the result as a `Nat` value. This line is not executed until `a` has completed, since it uses the `await` expression.

These two lines can be combined into one to await an asynchronous call directly, such as:

```motoko no-repl
actor {
  let n : Nat = await Counter.read();
}
```

## Actor classes

Actor classes provide the ability for a series of actors to be created programmatically. To define actor classes, a separate classes source file needs to be used. This tutorial will demonstrate how to define and import actor classes using the following example that implements a key-value store that maps keys (type `Nat`) to values (type `Text`). Then, it provides two functions, `insert` and `lookup`, which can be used for working with the key-value store.

To distribute data, the set of keys (`k`) will be partitioned into `n` buckets. For this example, you'll set `n` as a fixed value of `8`.

The bucket index value (`i`) for the value of `k`, will be determined by the remainder value of `k` divided by `n`. Then, the `i`th bucket will receive a dedicated actor used to store the text values (`v`) associated with the keys in the bucket.

The actor responsible for bucket `i` is obtained as an instance of the actor class `Bucket(i)`.

### Defining an actor class

Consider the following code that defines an actor class, stored in a file named `Buckets.mo`:

```motoko
import Nat "mo:base/Nat";
import Map "mo:base/RBTree";

actor class Bucket(n : Nat, i : Nat) {

  type Key = Nat;
  type Value = Text;

  let map = Map.RBTree<Key, Value>(Nat.compare);

  public func get(k : Key) : async ?Value {
    assert((k % n) == i);
    map.get(k);
  };

  public func put(k : Key, v : Value) : async () {
    assert((k % n) == i);
    map.put(k,v);
  };

};
```

In this example, the following happens:

- A bucket stores the current key-value map in a mutable variable named `map`. This contains an imperative RBTree that is initially empty.

- Then, the `get(k)` function is defined. This is a bucket actor that returns any value stored at `k` and returns `map.get(k)`.

- The `put(k, v)` function is defined. This is a bucket actor that updates the current map to map `k` to `?v` by calling `map.put(k, v)`.

Both the functions `get(k)` and `put(k, v)` use the `class` parameters of `n` and `i` to verify that the key is appropriate for the bucket through the assertion of `((k % n) == i)`.

### Defining an actor within the actor class

Then, you'll implement a coordinating `Map` actor in a file called `Map.mo`:

```motoko no-repl
import Array "mo:base/Array";
import Buckets "Buckets";

actor Map {

  let n = 8; // number of buckets

  type Key = Nat;
  type Value = Text;

  type Bucket = Buckets.Bucket;

  let buckets : [var ?Bucket] = Array.init(n, null);

  public func get(k : Key) : async ?Value {
    switch (buckets[k % n]) {
      case null null;
      case (?bucket) await bucket.get(k);
    };
  };

  public func put(k : Key, v : Value) : async () {
    let i = k % n;
    let bucket = switch (buckets[i]) {
      case null {
        let b = await Buckets.Bucket(n, i); // dynamically install a new Bucket
        buckets[i] := ?b;
        b;
      };
      case (?bucket) bucket;
    };
    await bucket.put(k, v);
  };

};
```

In this example, the following happens:

- The `Buckets` actor class is imported as the module `Buckets`.

- The `Map` actor maintains an array of `n` allocated buckets. Each entry in the array is initially a `null` value, with entries populated with Bucket actors on demand.

- When the function `get(k, v)` is called on the `Map` actor:

    - The remainder value of key (`k`) divided by `n` is used to determine the index (`i`) value of the bucket responsible for that key.

    - The function returns `null` of the index value of the bucket does not exist.

    - If the index value exists, it delegates the key to that bucket by calling `bucket.get(k, v)`.

- When the function `put(k, v)` is called on the `Map` actor:

    - The remainder value of key (`k`) divided by `n` is used to determine the index (`i`) value of the bucket responsible for that key.

    - If the bucket does not exist, the bucket is installed using an asynchronous call to the constructor function `Buckets.Bucket(n, i)`. When the result is returned, it records it in the array `buckets`.

    - Then it delegates the insertion of the key-value pair into the bucket by calling `bucket.put(k, v)`.

## Using multiple actors

Until this point, you've interacted with one actor defined in our `backend` <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> Motoko file. Next, you're going to create a project that uses multiple actors. Remember that only one actor can be defined in a Motoko file, and a single actor is always compiled into a single canister. To create multiple actors, you'll create multiple Motoko files and build multiple canisters. To do this, you'll define two canisters in your project's `dfx.json` configuration file.

You'll create two actors unrelated to one another:

- A `characterCount` actor which takes a string, counts it's length, then returns a `Bool` value if the total length of the string is divisible by `2`.

- A `Daemon` actor that provides mock functions for starting and stopping a daemon. A daemon is a program that runs continuously in the background. This actor assigns a variable and prints messages; it is purely for this tutorial's demonstration purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [0.3 Developer environment setup](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-0/dev-env).

### Creating a new project

To get started, create a new project in your working directory. Open a terminal window, navigate into your working directory (`developer_ladder`), then use the following commands to start `dfx` and create a new project:

```
dfx start --clean --background
dfx new multiple_actors
```

You will be prompted to select the language that your backend canister will use. Select 'Motoko':

```
? Select a backend language: ›
❯ Motoko
  Rust
  TypeScript (Azle)
  Python (Kybra)
```

:::info
`dfx` versions `v0.17.0` and newer support this `dfx new` interactive prompt. [Learn more about `dfx v0.17.0`](/blog/2024/02/14/news-and-updates/update#dfx-v0170).
:::

Then, select a frontend framework for your frontend canister. Select 'No frontend canister':

```
  ? Select a frontend framework: ›
  SvelteKit
  React
  Vue
  Vanilla JS
  No JS template
❯ No frontend canister
```

Lastly, you can include extra features to be added to your project:

```
  ? Add extra features (space to select, enter to confirm) ›
⬚ Internet Identity
⬚ Bitcoin (Regtest)
⬚ Frontend tests
```

Then, navigate into the new project directory:

```
cd multiple_actors
```

### Configuring canisters in `dfx.json`

As you've seen in previous portions of the developer ladder, when a new project is created with `dfx`, a default `dfx.json` file is created in the project's directory. For this guide, you'll need to edit `dfx.json` to specify our two canisters and the location of their Motoko files.

First, open the `dfx.json` file in your code editor. Delete the existing content and replace it with the following:

```json title="dfx.json"
{
  "canisters": {
    "character_count": {
      "main": "src/character_count/main.mo",
      "type": "motoko"
    },
    "daemon": {
      "main": "src/daemon/main.mo",
      "type": "motoko"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "version": 1
}
```

In this file, you can see the definition for each of your two canisters with correlate with each of your two actors. Each canister's Motoko file is configured to be at `src/CANISTER_NAME/main.mo`. Since these directories and files do not exist yet, the next step is to create them.

### Creating canister directories and Motoko files

First, create new directories for each of your canisters and create an empty `main.mo` file in each:

```bash
mkdir src/character_count && touch src/character_count/main.mo
mkdir src/daemon && touch src/daemon/main.mo
```

### Creating the `characterCount` actor

Let's start with the `character_count` canister. Open the `src/character_count/main.mo` file in your code editor and insert the following code:

```motoko title="src/character_count/main.mo"
import Text "mo:base/Text";
import Bool "mo:base/Bool";

actor characterCount {

    public func test(text: Text) : async Bool {
        let size = Text.size(text);
        return size % 2 == 0;
    };
};
```

In this example, the following happens:

- The actor `characterCount` is defined.

- Then, a public function called `test` is defined. This function takes an input of type `Text` and returns an async response of type `Bool`.

- Then, the variable `size` is defined as the length of the inputted text.

- If `size` is divisible by 2 without a remainder, the `Bool` of 'True' is returned. If not, the `Bool` of 'False' is returned.


### Creating the 'Daemon' actor

Next, let's open the `src/daemon/main.mo` file your code editor and insert the following code:

```motoko title="src/daemon/main.mo"
import Text "mo:base/Text";

actor Daemon {
  stable var running = false;

  public func launch() : async Text {
    running := true;
    debug_show "The daemon process is running";
  };

  public func stop(): async Text {
    running := false;
    debug_show "The daemon is stopped";
  };
};
```

In this example, the following happens:

- The actor `Daemon` is defined.

- A stable variable called `running` is defined as having the value `false`.

- A public function called `launch` is defined. This takes no input and returns an async response of type `Text`. It updates the value of the `running` variable to `true`, and the text response "The daemon process is running" is returned.

- A public function called `stop` is defined. This takes no input and returns an async response of type `Text`. It updates the value of the `running` variable to `false`, and the text response "The daemon process is stopped" is returned.


### Deploying the actors locally

Now let's deploy our actors locally by compiling them into canisters with the command:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

The output of this command will resemble the following:

```bash
Installing code for canister character_count, with canister ID aax3a-h4aaa-aaaaa-qaahq-cai
Installing code for canister daemon, with canister ID c5kvi-uuaaa-aaaaa-qaaia-cai
Deployed canisters.
URLs:
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    character_count: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=c2lt4-zmaaa-aaaaa-qaaiq-cai&id=aax3a-h4aaa-aaaaa-qaahq-cai
    daemon: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=c2lt4-zmaaa-aaaaa-qaaiq-cai&id=c5kvi-uuaaa-aaaaa-qaaia-cai
```


### Interacting with multiple actors

Once the canisters containing your actors have been deployed, you can interact with each actor using the `dfx canister call` command. For example, to use the `characterCount` actor, you can make a call to the `character_count` canister such as:

```bash
dfx canister call character_count test '("developer ladder")'
```

This command makes a call to the `character_count` canister, directly to the public function `test`. The result of this call should return a `false` response.

Then, to interact with the `Daemon` actor, you can make a call to the `daemon` canister such as:

```bash
dfx canister call daemon launch
```

This command makes a call to the `daemon` canister, directly to the public function `launch`. The result of this call should return a `("\"The daemon process is running\"")` response.
