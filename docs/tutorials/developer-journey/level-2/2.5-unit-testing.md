# 2.5: Unit, integration, and end2end testing

## Overview

Testing code is an important stage of any development workflow. Without proper testing before the code is put into production, bugs and errors that may have been caught during testing can be detrimental to production environments. At this point in of our developer journey, it's time to explore tools that can be used to test our code. 

There are three primary types of testing:

- **Unit testing:** Tests individual functions and calculations to assure that they generate data or return the expected result; tests a single *unit* at a time.

- **Integration testing:** Tests several functions, calculations, and portions of the code together; tests how different parts *integrate* with one another. A common form of integration testing is known as *continuous integration* testing, or CI testing.

- **End2end (e2e) testing:** Tests the app's complete workflow, including buttons, forms, and frontend assets; tests the app from *end to end*. 

## Motoko unit testing

The Motoko base library contains a series of test files that can be used for unit testing. There are tests for individual types, such as `Text`, `Array`, `Func`, etc. The full library of test files can be found [here](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base/tree/master/test). 

Many of these tests use a library called Motoko Matchers. Motoko Matchers is a test library that contains several packages that can be imported and used to provide testing functionalities. 

Let's take a look at a simple unit test. This unit test will test the program's error messages:


```motoko
import M "mo:matchers/Matchers";
import T "mo:matchers/Testable";
import Suite "mo:matchers/Suite";

let suite = Suite.suite("My test suite", [
    Suite.suite("Nat tests", [
        Suite.test("10 is 10", 10, M.equals(T.nat(10))),
        Suite.test("5 is greater than three", 5, M.greaterThan<Nat>(3)),
    ])
]);
Suite.run(suite);
```

This unit test does the following:

- First, it imports the `Suite`, `Testable` and `Matchers` packages from the Motoko Matchers project. 

    - `Suite` is a package that defines a simple test runner.

    - `Testable` is a package that provides functionality for units to be compared in a test. 

    - `Matchers` is a package that provides functionality for composable assertions that can be used in tests.

- Then, it defines a `Suite`, which is used to build a tree of tests to be run.

- In the suite, 2 tests are defined. One tests if the `Nat` value `10` is equal to `10`. The second tests if the `Nat` value of `5` is greater than `3`. 

- Lastly, the suite is run with the line `Suite.run(suite)`.

### Canister unit testing
In addition to the `Suite`, `Testable` and `Matchers` packages, Motoko Matchers also contains a `Canister` package. The `Canister` package can be used to execute unit tests for canisters. Below is an example that uses this `Canister` package:

```motoko
import Canister "canister:CanisterName";
import C "mo:matchers/Canister";
import M "mo:matchers/Matchers";
import T "mo:matchers/Testable";

actor {
    let it = C.Tester({ batchSize = 8 });
    public shared func test() : async Text {

        it.should("greet me", func () : async C.TestResult = async {
          let greeting = await Canister.greet("Bob");
          M.attempt(greeting, M.equals(T.text("Hello, Bob!")))
        });

        it.shouldFailTo("greet my friend", func () : async () = async {
          let greeting = await Canister.greet("George");
          ignore greeting
        });

        await it.runAll()
        // await it.run()
    }
}
```

This unit test does the following:

- First, it imports a canister called `CanisterName`. This allows the result of functions within the canister to be tested. 

- Then, it imports the `Canister`, `Testable` and `Matchers` packages from the Motoko Matchers project. 

- A `batchSize` is defined; this determines how many times the test will be run. 

- Two tests are defined. Both test the result of the canister's `greet` function: 

    - The first tests if the canister's greeting function is passed the text 'Bob', does the result text equal 'Hello, Bob!'?

    - The second tests if the greeting doesn't greet 'Bob' and instead greets 'George', the greeting should be ignored. 

- Then, it runs all tests in the batch, indicated by the `runAll()` call.

## Rust unit testing

In this developer journey series, we'll continue to focus on exploring and using Motoko. However, it's important to make note of the resources available for Rust testing.

For information about Rust unit testing, see the documentation [here](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#test-upgrades) and [here](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#target-independent). 

You may also consider the [DFINITY Rust guidelines on testing](https://docs.dfinity.systems/dfinity/spec/meta/rust.html#_tests).

## Tests using PocketIC

PocketIC is a community-developed project that provides local canister testing using a Python library. Using PocketIC, developers can write tests for their canister in Python, then deploy the scripts to interact with their local IC replica. An example test with PocketIC might look like:

```python
from pocket_ic import PocketIC

pic = PocketIC()
canister_id = pic.create_canister()

# use PocketIC to interact with your canisters
pic.add_cycles(canister_id, 1_000_000)
response = pic.update_call(canister_id, method="greeting", ...)
assert(response == 'Hello, PocketIC!')
```

You can learn more about PocketIC [here](https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic-py#readme).

### Tests using Light Replica

Light Replica is a community-developed project designed to provide a local testing and development environment similar to Ethereum's Truffle or Hardhat tools. Light Replica creates a local node designed to replicate the behavior of a real IC node that includes additional logging and functions to assist with testing. Using this local node, any Wasm file can be tested and interacted with as if it were deployed on a live production node. The Light Replica's codebase includes tests primarily written in Rust and Typescript, and can be beneficial as a tool for Rust development testing, but can be used with any canister that has been compiled into a Wasm file. 

You can learn more about Light Replica [here](https://github.com/icopen/lightic/tree/main).

## End2end (e2e) testing

Now, let's take a look at creating a project and setting up end2end (e2e) testing for the project. 

### Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [0.3: Developer environment setup](../level-0/03-dev-env.md).

### Creating a new project

To get started, create a new project in your working directory. Open a terminal window, navigate into your working directory (`developer_journey`), then use the commands:

```
dfx start --clean --background
dfx new e2e_tests
cd e2e_tests
```

### Setting up the project

Then, we can remove the `src/e2e_tests_frontend` folder and any sub folders. We won't be using a frontend in this project. 

```
rm -r src/e2e_tests_frontend
```

Then, remove the `e2e_tests_frontend` configuration from the `dfx.json` file. Once that has been completed, your `dfx.json` file should resemble the following:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "e2e_tests_backend": {
      "main": "src/e2e_tests_backend/main.mo",
      "type": "motoko"
    }
  },
  "version": 1
}
```

Next, we'll install `vitest` and `isomorphic-fetch` with the command:

```
npm install --save-dev vitest isomorphic-fetch
```

Then, open your `package.json` file and insert `"test": "vitest"` in the `scripts` category, such as:

```
...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack",
    "prebuild": "dfx generate",
    "start": "webpack serve --mode development --env development",
    "deploy:local": "dfx deploy --network=local",
    "deploy:ic": "dfx deploy --network=ic",
    "generate": "dfx generate e2e_tests_backend",
    "test": "vitest"
  },
...
```

:::info
Need the full `package.json` file? A repo containing the full project for this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/krpeacock/sample-canister-e2e).
:::


Now let's create a folder to contain our test files. It is a common practice to store them in the `./src/tests/` folder of your project, so let's create that folder with the command:

```
mkdir src/tests/
```

### Creating an agent

Now, we'll create a mixture of JavaScript and TypeScript files to create a utility that'll be used to create an **agent** using generated declarations. This file will be called `actor.js`. 

:::caution
We'll be diving a bit into using an **agent** in this portion of the tutorial. Note that we've briefly mentioned agents thus far in our developer journey, but we haven't fully explored agents yet. We will cover agents in a future tutorial, but for this tutorial it is important to know that an agent a library used to make calls to the Internet Computer public interface. We'll be using it to communicate the canister's public methods, defined in the `declarations/e2e_tests_backend/e2e_tests_backend.did.js`, to the file containing our the code for our tests. 
:::

Create a new file in `src/tests/` called `actor.js`, then insert the following content:

```js
import { Actor, HttpAgent } from "@dfinity/agent";
import fetch from "isomorphic-fetch";
import canisterIds from ".dfx/local/canister_ids.json";
import { idlFactory } from "../declarations/e2e_tests_backend/e2e_tests_backend.did.js";

export const createActor = async (canisterId, options) => {
  const agent = new HttpAgent({ ...options?.agentOptions });
  await agent.fetchRootKey();

  // Creates an actor with using the candid interface and the HttpAgent
  return Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
    agent,
    canisterId,
    ...options?.actorOptions,
  });
};

export const e2e_tests_backendCanister = canisterIds.e2e_tests_backend.local;

export const e2e_tests_backend = await createActor(e2e_tests_backendCanister, {
  agentOptions: { host: "http://127.0.0.1:8080", fetch },
});
```

This agent file does the following:

- Sets up file handlers by reading the canister IDs from their associated JSON file.

- Fetches the root key since we are testing locally. 

- Imports the interface description language (IDL) from the declarations file (`../declarations/e2e_tests_backend/e2e_tests_backend.did.js`).

- Creates a default actor. 

### Creating a test file

Now it's time to create our test file. Create a new file in `src/tests/` called `e2e_tests_backend.test.ts`, then insert the following content:

```ts
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import { Actor, CanisterStatus, HttpAgent } from "@dfinity/agent";
import { Principal } from "@dfinity/principal";
import { e2e_tests_backendCanister, e2e_tests_backend } from "./actor";

test("should handle a basic greeting", async () => {
  const result1 = await e2e_tests_backend.greet("test");
  expect(result1).toBe("Hello, test!");
});
```

In this test file, the following things happen:

- The necessary packages are imported.

- The necessary agent functionalities are imported from the `actor.js` file.

- A test method is defined which accepts two arguments - a test name and a function.

- Inside the test method, `expect` is used to check the result of the `greet` function against the expected result. 

### Running a basic test

Next let's deploy the canister and run our test with the commands:

```
dfx deploy
dfx generate
npm test
```

The test should be successful and return output such as:

```
 ✓ src/tests/e2e_tests_backend.test.ts (1)
   ✓ should handle a basic greeting

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  1 passed (1)
   Start at  16:24:03
   Duration  205ms (transform 32ms, setup 0ms, collect 68ms, tests 11ms, environment 0ms, prepare 41ms)


 PASS  Waiting for file changes...
       press h to show help, press q to quit
```

### Running a complex test

Now let's create a more complex test that checks the canister's metadata using the `CanisterStatus` API. Insert the following code at the end of the `src/tests/e2e_tests_backend.test.ts` file:

```ts
test("Should contain a candid interface", async () => {
  const agent = Actor.agentOf(e2e_tests_backend) as HttpAgent;
  const id = Principal.from(e2e_tests_backendCanister);

  const canisterStatus = await CanisterStatus.request({
    canisterId: id,
    agent,
    paths: ["time", "controllers", "candid"],
  });

  expect(canisterStatus.get("time")).toBeTruthy();
  expect(Array.isArray(canisterStatus.get("controllers"))).toBeTruthy();
  expect(canisterStatus.get("candid")).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    "service : {
      greet: (text) -> (text) query;
    }
    "
  `);
});
```

:::info
Need the full `src/tests/e2e_tests_backend.test.ts` file? A repo containing the full project for this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/krpeacock/sample-canister-e2e).
:::

This test simply checks that our canister's metadata contains a Candid interface.

Then, run the test again with the `npm test` command. This time, the output should reflect 2 successful tests:

```
 ✓ src/tests/e2e_tests_backend.test.ts (2)
   ✓ should handle a basic greeting
   ✓ Should contain a candid interface

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  2 passed (2)
   Start at  16:27:26
   Duration  247ms (transform 32ms, setup 0ms, collect 66ms, tests 62ms, environment 0ms, prepare 39ms)


 PASS  Waiting for file changes...
       press h to show help, press q to quit
```

## Integration testing

Now that we have a mini tutorial project to use, we'll use it to demonstrate **continuous integration** testing. CI testing is a common automated testing workflow. One example of CI testing is done through Github, where a repository can be configured to run a test every time a change is pushed to the repository's code. 

Before we upload our code to Github, first edit the `package.json` file. In the `scripts` section of this file, add the following lines:

```
"ci": "vitest run",
"preci": "dfx stop; dfx start --background --clean; dfx deploy; dfx generate"
```

This tells the code to automatically start dfx and deploy the project's canister.

Then, add a Github workflow configuration. To do this, create a `.github` folder, with a `workflows` subfolder in your project with the command:

```
mkdir .github
mkdir .github/workflows
```

Create a new file `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`, then insert the following content into this file:

```
name: End to End

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - edited
      - synchronize

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-20.04]
        ghc: ['8.8.4']
        spec:
          - '0.16.1'
        node:
          - 16

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

      - run: npm install

      - run: echo y | sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"

      - run: npm run ci
        env:
          CI: true
          REPLICA_PORT: 8000
```
