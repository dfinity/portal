# 0.6 Deploying your first dapp

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

Now that you've covered the fundamentals of ICP, it's time to start developing your first application. To get started quickly and seamlessly, you'll use [ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja), which was introduced in the previous module, [0.5: Introduction to tooling](05-tooling.mdx).

Projects on ICP have a default architecture of two canisters: a frontend canister and a backend canister. The **frontend canister** is essentially a web server. It stores the web assets for the application’s user interface and interacts with the backend through the use of an **agent**. The **backend canister** stores the application’s data and provides endpoints to access and modify the data. Backend canisters can be written in a variety of different languages (Motoko, Rust, TypeScript, and more) through the use of canister development kits (CDKs).

## Hello, world!

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Motoko" label="Motoko">

This tutorial will use the Motoko ["Hello, world!" example](https://icp.ninja/projects/hello-world) on ICP Ninja.

Let's review the project's file structure:


```bash
├── backend      # Folder containing the source code of your dapp's backend.
│   ├──  app.mo  # The default source code file; this is the file you'll be working with in this tutorial.
├── frontend     # Folder containing the asset files for your dapp's frontend.
│   ├──  index.html   # Entrypoint file for the frontend.
│   ├──  package.json
│   ├──  vite.config.js
├── dfx.json     # The configuration file for your Internet Computer dapp.
├── mops.toml    # Package configuration file for Motoko.
├── README.md    # Information about the project and using ICP Ninja.
```

### dfx.json​

The `dfx.json` file in the root directory defines the canisters that make up the application and where their source code is located. This project uses the following `dfx.json` file:

```json title=dfx.json file=../../../references/samples/motoko/hello_world/dfx.json
```

This tutorial will use the Rust ["Hello, world!" example](https://icp.ninja/projects/hello-world) on ICP Ninja.

Let's review the project's file structure:


```bash
├── backend      # Folder containing the source code of your dapp's backend.
│   ├── Cargo.toml # Package configuration file for Rust.
│   ├── lib.rs   # The default source code file; this is the file you'll be working with in this tutorial.
├── frontend     # Folder containing the asset files for your dapp's frontend.
│   ├──  index.html   # Entrypoint file for the frontend.
│   ├──  package.json
│   ├──  vite.config.js
├── dfx.json     # The configuration file for your Internet Computer dapp.
├── mops.toml    # Package configuration file for Motoko.
├── README.md    # Information about the project and using ICP Ninja.
```


### dfx.json​

The `dfx.json` file in the root directory defines the canisters that make up the application and where their source code is located. This project uses the following `dfx.json` file:

```json title=dfx.json file=../../../references/samples/rust/hello_world/dfx.json
```

Learn more about [dfx.json](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx-json).

### Cargo.toml

Your project's `Cargo.toml` file in the `backend` folder specifies the path to the main source file and lists the Rust packages (crates) your `lib.rs` file depends on. This configuration allows the Rust compiler to know how to build and link your code. This project uses the following `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml title=Cargo.toml file=../../../references/samples/rust/hello_world/backend/Cargo.toml
```

Now, let's review the `backend/app.mo` file to learn about the application's functions.

```motoko title=app.mo file=../../../references/samples/motoko/hello_world/backend/app.mo
```

- First an actor named `HelloWorld` is defined. An actor is an object that can hold state and interact with the world through messages.
  - This actor is defined as `persistent`, meaning the variables within the actor will be stored in stable memory and persist across canister upgrades.
- Then a variable called `greeting` is defined.
- A method is defined to modify the canister's state and update the text stored in the `greeting` variable.
- A method will query and return the text stored in `greeting,` followed by the text passed to the method.

Now, let's review the `backend/lib.rs` file to learn about the application's functions.

```rust title=lib.rs file=../../../references/samples/rust/hello_world/backend/lib.rs
```

- First the `ic_stable_structures` memory manager is defined, followed by the `thread_local!` macro. This stores the program's variables in stable memory so their values will persist across canister upgrades. Stable memory will be covered at length in a future module.
- The `set_greeting` method is defined to modify the canister's state and update the text stored in the `greeting` variable.
- The `greet` method will query and return the text stored in `greeting,` followed by the text passed to the method.

### Calling the backend canister​

Click the "Deploy" button in the upper right corner of the code editor. ICP Ninja will deploy the project, then return the project's canister URLs:

```
Deploying code onchain...
→ Reserving canisters onchain
→ Building backend
→ Building frontend
→ Uploading frontend assets
Backend Internet Computer URL:
https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.icp1.io/?id=6kwk6-qqaaa-aaaab-qbmga-cai
🥷🚀🎉 Your dapp's Internet Computer URL is ready:
https://4u45u-3aaaa-aaaab-qbluq-cai.icp1.io
⏰ Your dapp will be available for 20 minutes
```

The backend canister URL will bring you to a Candid API interface that allows you to call the methods defined in the backend.

In the `greet` method input box, insert the input "ICP," then select the "Query" option. The call will be sent to the `greet` method, which was given the input `"ICP."` The backend canister will process the call and return the response defined in the method. Since the method is defined as a `query` method, the canister simply returns data to the caller; it does not alter the canister's state.

```
("Hello, ICP!")
```

In contrast, `setGreeting` (Motoko variation) / `set_greeting` (Rust variation) is an update call that **does** alter the canister’s state. Calling it will change the data stored in the `greeting` variable, which will then result in the `greet` function returning a different response when called.

Insert "Hi, " into the `setGreeting` (Motoko variation) / `set_greeting` (Rust variation) function's input, then select "Call." Then, call the `greet` function again and observe the new output.

```
("Hi, ICP!")
```

## Frontend

The frontend of an application is used to facilitate user interaction with the methods defined in the backend. It is made up of assets, most commonly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

On ICP, an application's frontend is created through these steps:

1. A developer creates frontend assets.

2. The project's `dfx.json` file defines the frontend canister and specifies it as `"type": "asset"`.

3. When the project is deployed, `dfx` deploys an implementation of the [asset canister interface](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/docs/design/asset-canister-interface.md) to the canister. It then adds an API client called the [ICP JavaScript agent](/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/agents/overview) to the frontend assets and uploads all assets to the canister. The ICP JavaScript agent facilitates the communication between the frontend and the backend. In general, ICP agents are libraries for interacting with canisters' public interfaces.

## How does the frontend communicate with the backend?

When a user loads the application, the web browser fetches the user interface from the frontend canister. Once the frontend is loaded into the browser, the user can interact with it, triggering messages to be sent to the backend.

<div class="text--center">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/docs/app-flow.png")}
    alt="Application flow"
    width="800"
  />
</div>

For example, the `src/hello_frontend/index.html` file defines a simple HTML page that embeds the JavaScript code used to communicate with the backend canister:

```html title=index.html file=../../../references/samples/motoko/hello_world/frontend/index.html#L20-L33
```

In this script, the backend declarations are imported with `import { backend } from 'declarations/backend';`. Declaration files define the public methods of a canister and their input and output types. Motoko declaration files are generated by `dfx` during the build process, while Rust declarations must be exported with the `candid_extractor` tool or written by hand. In this example's Rust variation, the declaration file is exported using the `candid_extractor`. If you build this project locally, you will see the project's declaration files; they are not shown in the ICP Ninja file viewer.

When the agent makes a call to the backend canister, it uses these declaration files to determine which public methods it can submit requests to. Then it will create and send the request containing the request type, canister ID, method name, and any input or arguments to be passed to the method.

In this example, the user interface includes a text input box and a button to submit the input. When the button is pressed, the ICP JavaScript agent sends a request to the `backend` canister's `greet` method that includes the user's text input. The backend processes the request, then responds to the agent with an outgoing message that includes the result of the method.

## Viewing the dapp on the mainnet

In the deployment output, there are two canister URLs. Open the second URL to view the frontend of your application deployed on the mainnet. You should see a very simple "Enter your name" input box. Insert your name, then click the "Click me!" button. You will see the response, `"Hello, <name>!"`, indicating that your text input was successfully received and processed by the backend's `greet` method.

Want to share your new dapp with a friend? Simply send them the frontend canister's URL, such as: `https://7azie-saaaa-aaaab-qbmba-cai.icp1.io`
