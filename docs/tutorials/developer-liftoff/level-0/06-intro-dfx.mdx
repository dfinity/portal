`dfx` is a command line tool used for creating, managing, and deploying dapps onto ICP.

The `dfx` parent command has several flags and subcommands that can be used to perform a wide array of operations. First, you'll take a look at the basic usage of the command, and then you'll get started creating your first project using dfx.

## Basic usage

The syntax for using dfx is as follows:

```bash
dfx [subcommand] [flag]
```

### Subcommands

The following is a list of the essential `dfx` subcommands that you'll be using throughout the developer liftoff series. For the full list of all possible subcommands, check out the [dfx reference documentation](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-parent/).

- `build`: Used to build the <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> output from the project's source code.
- `canister`: Used to manage deployed canisters.
- `cycles`: Used to manage the <GlossaryTooltip>cycles</GlossaryTooltip> balance for your identity.
- `deploy`: Deploys one or all canisters from the project's source code. By default, all canisters are deployed.
- `help`: Returns usage information for a specific subcommand.
- `identity`: Used to create and manage identities.
- `info`: Used to display information, such as version or port values.
- `ledger`: Used to interact with accounts within the ledger canister.
- `new`: Used to create a new project. By default, creates a Motoko project.
- `ping`: Used to test network connectivity to the mainnet or the local canister execution environment.
- `quickstart`: Used to perform an initial one-time identity and wallet setup.
- `start`: Used to start the local canister execution environment for the current project.
- `stop`: Used to stop the local canister execution environment.
- `upgrade`: Used to upgrade the version of dfx installed.

### Flags

- `-h`, `--help`: Used to display usage information.
- `-q`, `--quiet`: Used to suppress informational messages.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Used to display detailed information about operations.
- `-V`, `--version`: Used to display the version of dfx installed.

### Options

Below are the essential options that you'll be referencing throughout the developer liftoff. For the full list of options, see the [reference documentation](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-parent/).

- `--identity <identity>`: Used to specify the user identity to be used with the command.
- `--logfile <logfile>`: Used to write the command's output logs to a specific file.

## Creating a new project with dfx

:::info
You can follow along using the web IDE [ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja/) as an alternative developer environment.
:::

All dapps on ICP start off as **projects**. Projects are created using the `dfx new` command.

To get started, you'll use the default app to demonstrate how to create a project and explore project structure.

### Step 1: Open a terminal window on your local computer.

Ensure that you are in your working directory, `developer_liftoff`.

### Step 2: Create a new project with the name 'hello_world' with the command:

```
dfx new hello_world --type=motoko --frontend=react
```

This command will create a new project using the default Motoko backend and React frontend. To create a project using the Rust project template, the flag `--type=rust` can be used instead.

Alternatively, you can open this project in the web IDE [ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja/projects/hello-world).

:::info
When creating new projects with `dfx`, only alphanumeric characters and underscores should be used. This is to assure that project names are valid within Motoko, JavaScript, and other contexts.
:::

This command will create a new project directory called `hello_world` that contains the project's default template files and a new git repository for your project.

### Step 3: Then, navigate into the project's directory with the command:

```bash
cd hello_world
```

## Exploring the default project structure

By default, the project structure will resemble the following:

```bash
hello_world/
├── README.md      # Default project documentation
├── dfx.json       # Project configuration file
├── node_modules   # Libraries for frontend development
├── package.json
├── src            # Source files directory
│   ├── hello_world_backend
│   │   └── main.mo
│   └── hello_world_frontend
│       ├── assets
│       │   └── favicon.ico
│       ├── index.html
│       ├── package.json
│       ├── src
│       │   ├── App.js
│       │   ├── index.scss
│       │   ├── logo2.svg
│       │   ├── main.js
│       │   └── vite-env.d.ts
│       ├── tsconfig.json
│       └── vite.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

In this directory, the following files and directories are notable:

- `README.md`: The default README file to be used for documenting your project.
- `dfx.json`: The default configuration file used to set configurable options for your project.
- `src/`: The source directory that contains all of your dapp's source files.
- `hello_world_backend`: The source directory that contains your dapp's backend code files.
- `hello_world_frontend`: The source directory that contains your dapp's frontend code files.
- `hello_world_backend/main.mo`: The default template Motoko file that can be modified or replaced to include your dapp's core programming logic.

## Reviewing the default configuration

By default, the `dfx.json` file will contain some automatically generated configuration settings for your new project. These settings will provide basic functionality for the default dapp, which is a simple 'Hello, world' program.

<div class="text--center">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/docs/app-arch.png")}
    alt="Application architecture"
    width="800"
  />
</div>

To review the default configuration file for the project, open the `dfx.json` file in a code or text editor. The contents will resemble the following:

```json title="dfx.json" file=../../../samples/motoko/hello_world/dfx.json

```

Let's explore these settings a bit further:

- There are two canisters defined in this file: `hello_world_frontend` and `hello_world_backend`.
- The `hello_world_backend` canister has a `main` attribute that specifies the file path of the program's core file, `main.mo`.
- The `hello_world_backend` canister has a `type` of 'motoko,' which specifies the programming language. If the canister was written in Rust, this value would read 'rust.'
- The `hello_world_frontend` canister has a dependency on the `hello_world_backend` canister, meaning it relies on the backend canister to be deployed and running for it to be deployed and run.
- The `hello_world_frontend` canister's assets are specified in the `source` configuration.
- Lastly, the `hello_world_frontend` canister has a `type` of 'assets,' configuring it as a frontend asset canister.

## Reviewing the default program code

Now that you've explored the default project structure, let's take a look at the default program code located in the `main.mo` file. This is located in the `src/hello_world_backend` directory. The developer liftoff will cover frontend development and the default files located in the frontend canister directory in a later tutorial.

New Motoko projects will always include a default, template `main.mo` file. To take a look at the file's default contents, open the `src/hello_world_backend/main.mo` file in a code or text editor. The code will resemble the following:

```motoko title="src/hello_world_backend/main.mo"
actor {
  public query func greet(name : Text) : async Text {
    return "Hello, " # name # "!";
  };
};
```

In this simple 'Hello, world' program, there are a few key elements:

- This code defines an `actor` rather than a `main` function as some other languages define. In Motoko, the `main` function is implicit in the file itself.
- Instead of the traditional 'Hello, world' that uses a simple `print` function, this version of 'Hello, world' defines an actor with a public `greet` function that takes an input of a name argument with the type of `Text`.
- Then, the program uses an async keyword to indicate that the program will return an async message that consists of a text string that is constructed using "Hello, ", the # operator, the name argument, and "!".

You'll explore actor objects, classes, and asynchronous messages in a future tutorial. For now, this will wrap up our introduction to `dfx`.
