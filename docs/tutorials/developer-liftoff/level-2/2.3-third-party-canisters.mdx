Third-party canisters are canisters that provide a public service at a static <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> ID. Some examples are the DFINITY NNS and Internet Identity canisters, but third-party canisters can also be made by community developers. Using third-party canisters can be a good way to add additional functionalities to your dapp. For example, by integrating the Internet Identity canister into your dapp, you can enable identity and authentication for the users of your application.

`dfx` enables a **dependency** workflow, where a canister can be configured to pull third-party canisters that it depends on into the local environment. This can be useful for developers who are looking to test the accuracy of their integration with the third-party canister and perform tests without paying cycles or using production environments. It also drastically simplifies the local deployment of canisters like the II canister, since you don't need to obtain the Wasm and Candid files for the canisters yourself—`dfx`` takes care of it in the background for you.

In this tutorial, you'll be focusing on pulling third-party canisters. If you're interested in developing third-party canisters that can be pulled by other developers, check out the [documentation on `dfx deps`](/docs/building-apps/advanced/using-third-party-canisters).

## Pulling third-party canister dependencies

Let's take a look at a basic example of pulling a third-party canister as a dependency. To do this, you'll use the `dfx deps` command, which is the `dfx` subcommand responsible for pulling canisters that are listed as dependencies of another canister in the project's `dfx.json` file.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [0.3 Developer environment setup](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-0/dev-env).

### Creating a new project

To get started, create a new project in your working directory. Open a terminal window, navigate into your working directory (`developer_ladder`), then use the following commands to start `dfx` and create a new project:

Use `dfx new <project_name>` to create a new project:

```
dfx start --clean --background
dfx new dependencies
```

You will be prompted to select the language that your backend canister will use. Select 'Motoko':

```
? Select a backend language: ›
❯ Motoko
  Rust
  TypeScript (Azle)
  Python (Kybra)
```

:::info
`dfx` versions `v0.17.0` and newer support this `dfx new` interactive prompt. [Learn more about `dfx v0.17.0`](/blog/2024/02/14/news-and-updates/update#dfx-v0170).
:::

Then, select a frontend framework for your frontend canister. Select 'None':

```
  ? Select a frontend framework: ›
  SvelteKit
  React
  Vue
  Vanilla JS
  No JS template
❯ None
```

Lastly, you can include extra features to be added to your project:

```
  ? Add extra features (space to select, enter to confirm) ›
⬚ Internet Identity
⬚ Bitcoin (Regtest)
⬚ Frontend tests
```

Then, navigate into the new project directory:

```
cd dependencies
```

You'll use the default 'Hello world' project in this example, then you'll pull the Internet Identity canister as a dependency of our `dependencies_backend` canister.

First, open the `dfx.json` file in your project's directory. You need to configure your `dependencies_backend` canister to have the dependencies of `internet_identity`, with canister ID `rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai` on the mainnet. This is the canister ID of the DFINITY canister used to interact with ICP's identity and authentication product called Internet Identity. The developer liftoff will dive deeper into II in a later tutorial; for now, you'll just use it to demonstrate how third-party canisters can be used. You can do so by editing our `dfx.json` file to reflect the following configuration:

```json title="dfx.json"
{
    "canisters": {
        "dependencies_backend": {
            "type": "motoko",
            "main": "src/dependencies_backend/main.mo",
            "dependencies": [
                "internet_identity"
            ]
        },
        "internet_identity": {
            "type": "pull",
            "id": "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai"
        }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "args": "",
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env",
  "version": 1
}
```

Next, run the `dfx deps pull` command:

```bash
dfx deps pull
```

By running this command, the following steps are executed:

- First, the dependency canister is fetched and the Wasm for it is downloaded.

- Then, the hash of the downloaded Wasm is verified against the hash of the deployed canister on the mainnet.

- Next, a series of information is extracted from the downloaded Wasm file, such as the `dfx` metadata and Candid information.

The `deps/` folder is also created in your project's root folder. The `deps/pulled.json` file will contain all major information regarding the project's dependencies. In this example, the `deps/pulled.json` file should resemble the following:

```json title="deps/pulled.json"
{
"canisters":{
    "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai": {
        "name": "internet_identity"
        "wasm_hash": "aad8c68dcfe77df9140581097ad4bb82d1eb6da036d228c1a21dfd25a6558ca2" ,
        "wasm_hash_download": "aad8c68dcfe77df9140581097ad4bb82dleb6da036d228c1a21dfd25a6558ca2" ,
        "init_guide": "Use '(null)'. for sensible defaults. See the candid interface for more details.",
        "init_arg": "(opt record { captcha_config = opt record {-max_unsolved_captchas= 50:nat64; captcha_trigger = variant {Static = variant {CaptchaDisabled}}}})",
        "candid_args": "(opt InternetIdentityInit)",
        "gzip": • true
    }
  }
}
```


### Using `dfx deps`

Next, you'll set the `init` arguments for the dependency canisters using the `dfx deps init` command. An `init` argument is an argument that will be passed to the canister when it is deployed. This command will iterate over all listed dependencies in the `pulled.json` file and set an empty argument for any that do not require an `init` argument. For those that require an `init` argument, they will be returned so that they can be set manually. Run the command:

```bash
dfx deps init
```

Now it's time to deploy our pulled dependency canister. Run the command:

```bash
dfx deps deploy
```

Lastly, let's deploy our project all together with the `dfx deploy` command:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

The output will include a local Candid UI URL for both the `dependencies_backend` canister, which has the default 'Hello world' code, and the local Candid UI URL for the Internet Identity canister.

```bash
Installing code for canister dependencies_backend, with canister ID bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
Deployed canisters.
URLs:
    Backend canister via Candid interface:
    dependencies_backend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai&id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
    internet_identity: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai&id=rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai
```

Now, you can interact with the II canister locally using the CLI or the Candid UI. In a future tutorial you'll integrate your backend canister with the II canister. For now, that'll wrap up this module.
