[Mops](https://mops.one) is a package manager for Motoko. In this guide, you'll explore how to download and install Mops, then how to import and use different libraries through it.

## What is a package manager?

A **package manager** is a collection of tools that automates installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages or libraries. They help efficiently manage the dependencies of a project. Mops and Vessel are two package managers for Motoko. Mops supports over 100 libraries for Motoko, spanning several different functionalities such as utility, encoding, cryptography, data structure libraries, and more.

## Using Mops with ICP Ninja

ICP Ninja supports adding Mops packages to projects. For example, open the [Flying Ninja project](https://icp.ninja/projects/flying-ninja) and view the `mops.toml` file to see the packages used within the project:

```toml
# Motoko dependencies (https://mops.one/)

[dependencies]
base = "0.14.1"
```

Simply edit this file with any Mops packages you'd like to use within your project. For example:

```toml
time = "1.0.7"
```

In the project's `dfx.json` file, you will see Mops configured as the package manager through the following line:

```json title="dfx.json"
...
{
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "packtool": "mops sources"
    }
  }
}
...
```

## Using Mops in a local environment

To install Mops, first be sure to have set up your developer environment and installed the IC SDK and Node.js, as described in the previous module, 0.3: Developer environment setup. Mops is supported in dfx versions 0.10.0 and higher.

Then, to install Mops, run the command:

```
npm i -g ic-mops
```

Create a new project in your working directory. Open a terminal window, navigate into your working directory (`developer_liftoff`), then use the following commands to start `dfx` and create a new project:

```
dfx start --clean --background
dfx new mops_example --type=motoko --no-frontend
cd mops_example
```

### Configuring your local project to use Mops

Then, open the `dfx.json` file within your project. Add Mops as a `packtool` in the file by adding the following line:

```json title="dfx.json"
{
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "packtool": "mops sources"
    }
  }
}
```

### Initializing Mops

Then, initialize the Mops configuration with the command:

```bash
mops init
```

You'll be prompted to choose whether you plan to use Mops to pull packages or publish packages:

```bash
? Select type: › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   Project (I just want to use mops packages in my project)
    Package (I plan to publish this package on mops)
```

In this case, select 'Project.' For more information about publishing packages, see the [publishing a package](#publishing-a-package) section.

You will also be prompted to choose if you'd like to use a GitHub workflow. This is optional.

### Adding packages to `mops.toml`.

To install a package with Mops, you need to specify the package in the `mops.toml` file within your project. To add a package to this file, you can use the command `maps add` and then the package name:

```bash
mops add base
```

Or, you can add packages directly from GitHub by specifying the repository's URL:

```bash
mops add https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base
```

You can also specify the branch, commit hash, or tag by adding `#<branch/tag/hash>`:

```bash
mops add https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base#moc-0.9.1
```

If you have a locally stored package, you can put the source files inside your project's directory and then add them by specifying the path:

```bash
mops add ./local-package
```

Using any of these workflows will add the package to the `mops.toml` file.

Then, to install all packages specified in this file, use the command:

```bash
mops install
```

### Publishing a package

If you develop a package that you'd like to publish so other developers can use it, you can publish it to the Mops registry! For instructions on publishing a package to Mops, check out the [Mops documentation](https://github.com/ZenVoich/mops#publish-a-package).



## Importing packages into your Motoko code

Once a package has been installed, you can import it into your Motoko code file using the line `import PackageName "mo:<package_name>";`, such as:

```motoko title="src/character_count/main.mo"
import Text "mo:base/Text";
import Bool "mo:base/Bool";

actor characterCount {

    public func test(text: Text) : async Bool {
        let size = Text.size(text);
        return size % 2 == 0;
    };
};
```
