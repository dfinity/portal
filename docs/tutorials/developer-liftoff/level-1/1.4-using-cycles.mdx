If you recall from the previous module, [Internet Computer terminology](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-0/ic-terms), cycles are used to measure the resources, such as memory, storage, and compute power, that are used by a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>. When a canister is deployed on the mainnet, cycles are 'charged' for every action that a canister performs.

To obtain cycles, the Internet Computer Protocol's utility token, ICP, can be converted into cycles and transferred into a canister to be used to pay for that canister's consumed resources. Cycles have a fixed price in [XDR](/docs/references/glossary#x) in order to make canister costs predictable and independent of the price of ICP. One trillion cycles always correspond to one XDR.

Since cycles are not a currency and are only used to pay for a canister's consumed resources, developers manage the distribution of cycles through a system canister called the **cycles ledger**. The cycles ledger provides functionality for developers to convert ICP into cycles, accept incoming cycles, send cycles to other canisters, and create canisters with cycles.

A developer's cycles balance is associated with the <GlossaryTooltip>principal</GlossaryTooltip> identity.

:::info
Recall that a principal is an entity that can be authenticated by ICP.
:::

Canisters each have their own cycles balance and don't use cycles associated with your identity. When you need to call a method that requires cycles, if the canister doesn't have enough cycles in its balance or if you're creating a new canister, you will need to proxy the call through the cycles ledger to attach the required cycles. To ensure canisters have a cycles balance, you need to deposit cycles into the canister's cycles balance, known as 'topping up' the canister.

For local canister execution, operations performed using cycles are done in the background. In a production environment with canisters deployed on the mainnet, canisters will need to have cycles explicitly registered and transferred into them. Production canisters can also have principals configured to act as **custodians**, who have permission to access the cycles wallet balance, wallet information, and send and receive cycles for the canister.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to obtain cycles. Then, in the next tutorial, you'll deploy a canister to the mainnet using those cycles.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [0.3 Developer environment setup](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-0/dev-env).

## Creating a developer identity

When you initially use `dfx`, a default developer identity is created. This identity is a `principal` data type, often referred to as your **principal identifier**. This identity is similar to a Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet address that you would use to interact with those ecosystems.

However, your developer identity principal is not the same as your account identifier that is specified in the [ledger](/docs/defi/token-standards/). Your identity principal and your account identifier are related, but they use different formats.

:::info
Your developer identity is a private/public key pair, while your principal identity is derived from the public key.

Each principal can control multiple accounts in the ICP (and other) ledgers.

You can learn more in the IC [specification](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec#principal).
:::

In this tutorial, you'll create a new identity principal with `dfx`, which you'll use to obtain and manage cycles.

First, ensure that `dfx` is running. If not, use the following command to start it:

```bash
dfx start --clean --background
```

Next you will create a new developer identity with the command:

```bash
dfx identity new DevJourney
```

::: caution
This command will return a seed phrase, which will be required to recover your identity if you ever need to. This seed phrase should be backed up so that any cycles associated with your identity are not lost.
:::

Set this identity as the one to be used by `dfx` in the current terminal session with the command:

```bash
dfx identity use DevJourney
```

You can get the principal ID of this identity with the command:

```bash
dfx identity get-principal
```

The principal will resemble the following format:

```bash
tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe
```

## Acquiring cycles

:::danger
Cycles are required to deploy to the mainnet. If you only plan to deploy to your local environment for testing, cycles are not required. The following tutorials will focus on local deployment to assure anyone can complete this tutorial series.

You may skip this tutorial if you do not plan to deploy to the mainnet.
:::

Cycles can be obtained by converting ICP tokens into cycles. There are a few ways to obtain ICP tokens, such as:

- Purchasing ICP tokens directly through a crypto exchange.
- Receiving ICP tokens as a reward for participating in the NNS governance.
- Receiving a grant of ICP tokens through the DFINITY Foundation.
- Receiving ICP tokens in return for providing resources as a node provider.

You need to obtain [ICP tokens](https://internetcomputer.org/icp-tokens), then convert them into cycles using `dfx`. However, when participating at DFINITY events like [hackathons](https://dfinity.org/hackathons) or working on a [developer grant](https://dfinity.org/grants), you will receive a coupon that you can redeem to claim free cycles from the [cycles faucet](https://anv4y-qiaaa-aaaal-qaqxq-cai.ic0.app/).

:::tip
Each developer identity has both a **principal** and a **ledger account identifier**.

A principal has the format `itk7v-ihlxk-ktdrh-fcnst-vkoou-orj77-52ogl-jqwj5-zpfdv-az3lr-xqe` and is used for canister ownership, management, and holding cycles.

A ledger account identifier has the format `e213184a548871a47fb526f3cba24e2ee2fbbc8129c4ab497ef2ce535130a0a4` and is used to send and receive tokens like ICP.
:::

First, get your account's ledger account ID:

```
dfx ledger account-id
```

Then, send ICP tokens to this ledger account ID. You can obtain [ICP tokens](https://internetcomputer.org/icp-tokens) from an [exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/markets) or through a [developer grant](https://dfinity.org/grants). If you are using an exchange, initiate a withdrawal transaction, then enter the ledger account ID as the "destination" address to send ICP tokens to.

After you have sent ICP tokens to your ledger account, check the ICP balance.

```
dfx ledger balance --network=ic
```

Converting ICP to cycles is done through the **cycles ledger**, a ledger canister that enables developer identities to convert, hold, send, and receive cycles.

The price of cycles is fixed against the price of [XDR](/docs/references/glossary#x), where 1 trillion cycles equals 1 XDR.

Cycles are measured in very large numbers, such as billions and trillions. When you talk about cycle transfers and replenishment, you will usually operate with trillions of cycles.

:::danger
These commands must be run with the `--network=ic` flag. The cycles ledger is not necessary for local development and therefore not part of the local replica.
:::

Next, convert ICP into cycles. Replace `AMOUNT` with the number of ICP tokens you want to convert into cycles.

```
dfx cycles convert --amount AMOUNT --network=ic
```

:::info Calculating how many cycles you need

The amount of cycles that your canister will use depends on a variety of factors. Cycles are charged for storage, compute, update messages, special features, and more. To get an approximation, you can view the [detailed cycles cost table](/docs/building-apps/essentials/gas-cost) or use the [cycles pricing calculator](/docs/building-apps/essentials/cost-estimations-and-examples).

:::

Lastly, confirm that the ICP was properly converted into cycles by checking the cycles balance.

```
dfx cycles balance --network=ic
```
