- [1.1 Exploring a live demo](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.1-live-demo): Before you begin developing your own dapps, let's explore a live, deployed canister that utilizes the playground through the `dfx deploy --playground` command. This module covers:
    - Overview of the playground.
    - An overview of the `dfx deploy --playground` command.
    - Deploying a canister to the playground using `dfx`.
    - Interacting with the canister via the CLI.
    - Interacting with the canister via the Candid interface.

- [1.2 Motoko level 1](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.2-motoko-lvl1): To develop your own dapp, you first need to cover the fundamentals of writing Motoko code. This module covers:

    - Acquiring cycles using a cycles coupon.
    - Converting ICP tokens to cycles.

- [1.5 Deploying canisters](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.5-deploying-canisters): Once you have acquired some cycles, you can deploy our dapp to the mainnet. This module covers:
    - Deploying to the mainnet.

- [1.6 Managing canisters](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.6-managing-canisters): Once your dapp is deployed on the mainnet, you need to learn how you can manage the canister. This module covers:
    - Obtaining a canister's ID.
    - Obtaining canister information.
    - Adding an identity as a controller of a canister.
    - Managing the running state of a canister.
