        - Final code.
    - Deploying the dapp locally.
    - Adding pre-developed frontend code.
    - Re-deploying the dapp.

- [1.4 Acquiring and using cycles](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.4-using-cycles): To deploy dapps on the mainnet, you'll need to acquire cycles. This module covers:
    - Overview of cycles.
    - Creating a developer identity.
    - Acquiring cycles using a cycles coupon.
    - Converting ICP tokens to cycles.

- [1.5 Deploying canisters](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.5-deploying-canisters): Once you have acquired some cycles, you can deploy our dapp to the mainnet. This module covers:
    - Deploying to the mainnet.

- [1.6 Managing canisters](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.6-managing-canisters): Once your dapp is deployed on the mainnet, you need to learn how you can manage the canister. This module covers:
    - Obtaining a canister's ID.
    - Obtaining canister information.
    - Adding an identity as a controller of a canister.
    - Managing the running state of a canister.
