Motoko is a programming language that has been developed and optimized for creating programs built on the Internet Computer. In this module, you'll cover the fundamental basics of Motoko that you'll use when you build your [first dapp](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.3-first-dapp).

## Basic concepts and terms

In previous modules, you've been introduced to and briefly discussed actors and how each <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> smart contract is represented by an actor. Within Motoko, the term actor is used to refer to any canister, regardless of the canister's language (Motoko, Rust, etc.). Motoko is designed specifically to make actors easy to write and use once the canister has been deployed.

With actors in mind, the following terms and concepts are essential to be aware of. Many of these concepts apply to several different programming languages, though you'll be focusing on their application within Motoko.

- **Declaration:** A declaration in Motoko is used to define immutable variables, mutable state, objects, actors, classes, and other data types.

- **Expression:** An expression in Motoko is used to describe computations that involve declarations.

- **Program:** A program in Motoko is a collection of expressions and declarations.

- **Value:** In Motoko, a value represents an entity that can be manipulated by a program.

- **Variable:** In Motoko, variables are used to store data or information that can be referenced or manipulated by a program.

- **Type:** A type in Motoko makes a precise prediction regarding the program's result.

## Motoko syntax

Motoko's program syntax uses declarations and expressions. Programs consist of an actor expression that is introduced using the keyword `actor`. To introduce the Motoko syntax, first you'll use small code snippets that do not define entire programs but rather some simple printed terminal output.

For example, the following code snippet consists of two **declarations** for the variables `x` and `y`, followed by an **expression**. This forms a single **program**.

```motoko no-repl
let x = 1; /// declaration
let y = x + 1; /// declaration
x * y + x; /// expression
```

In this snippet, the program's type is `Nat` (natural number), since when the program is run, the result value is a `Nat` value of 3. This tutorial series will dive into value types in [values](#values-and-evaluation).

Now, let's build upon this small snippet. If you introduce a block with enclosing braces `do {` and `}` and another variable `z`, you can amend your original program as follows:

```motoko no-repl
let z = do {
  let x = 1;
  let y = x + 1;
  x * y + x
};
```

The variable `z` now stores the result value of `3` and can be called by additional methods.

Next, let's look at using and importing the base Motoko library.

## Using the base library

Motoko is designed to minimize built-in types and operations, so whenever possible, the Motoko base library provides the necessary operations and types for developers to utilize.

The base library includes a selection of modules that focus on the core features of Motoko. The base library is still under development and is expected to grow in size as additional features are developed.

To import the base library, the `import` keyword can be used at the start of your Motoko code file. After the `import` keyword, you need to provide a **local module name** and a **file path** that the import declaration can use to locate the imported module.

For example, to import a local module named 'Debug,' you can use the following import statement:

```motoko no-repl no-repl
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
```

Then, to use this imported library, you can call the module with a line of code such as:

```motoko no-repl no-repl
Debug.print("hello world");
```

In this demonstration, you import Motoko code, indicated by the `mo:` prefix, then specify the `base/` path, indicating that you are using the base library, followed by the module's file name, `Debug.mo`. Note that the `.mo` extension is not included in the import statement.

Additionally, you can import Motoko code and other modules using their relative paths. For example, if you have a Motoko program named `types.mo` that you'd like to import into your Motoko file, you can use the following import declaration:

```motoko no-repl no-repl
import Types "./types";
```

In this import declaration, you don't need to include the `mo:` prefix or the `base/` path, since you are importing a module from a local relative path rather than the base library.

## Declarations and expressions

A declaration in Motoko is used to introduce immutable variables, mutable state, objects, classes, actors, and other data types. An expression is used to describe computations that involve these declarations.

To demonstrate declarations and expressions, recall our first sample project from above:

```motoko no-repl
let x = 1;
let y = x + 1;
x * y + x;
```

In this program, there are three declarations:

- Immutable variable `x`, defined via declaration `let x = 1;`.
- Immutable variable `y`, defined via declaration `let y = x + 1;`.
- An unnamed, implicit variable holding the final expression’s value, `x * y + x`.

The last expression, `x * y + x`, illustrates a more general principle where an expression can be thought of as a declaration where necessary, since the language implicitly declares an unnamed variable with that expression’s result value.

When an expression appears as the final declaration, the expression can have any type. In our example, the expression `x * y + x` has type `Nat`.

Type `Nat` refers to 'Natural numbers,' which consist of values such as `0, 1, 2, ...`. `Nat` values are not bound to a maximum size; rather, the runtime representation of these values accommodates arbitrary-sized numbers, making their "overflow" nearly impossible.

Motoko permits standard arithmetic operations as one would expect, such as:

```motoko no-repl
let x = 42 + (1 * 37) / 12: Nat
```

This program results in the value 45, also of type `Nat`.

Expressions can also be formed using a **block**. You can form a block expression from your list of declarations by enclosing it within curly brackets `{}`. A block expression is used to preserve the autonomy of the declaration list and the variable's names.

Blocks are only allowed as sub-expressions of **control flow expressions**. Control flow expressions are programming methods such as `if`, `loop`, `case`, etc. In any other place, you can use `do { ... }` to represent block expressions and distinguish blocks from object literals.

So, going back to the example, since there are no control flow expressions in our program, such as `if` or `loop`, you must use the `do  { ... }` expression:

```motoko no-repl
do {
  let x = 1;
  let y = x + 1;
  x * y + x
}
```

Using the `do { ... }` expression allows our code to remain a functioning program, but now our declared variables `x` and `y` are privately scoped within the block expression you have defined.

Next, you can use a block expression to produce a value within a larger, compound expression, such as:

```motoko no-repl
100 +
  (do {
     let x = 1;
     let y = x + 1;
     x * y + x
   })
```

You can see that nesting blocks preserves the autonomy of each separate declaration list and its variable names. Language theorists refer to this as **lexical scoping**, where variables' scopes may nest but do not interfere with one another as they nest.

To further demonstrate this, consider the following example that uses the `ignore` keyword to discard the return value of the `do` block:

```motoko no-repl
let x = 40; let y = 2;
ignore do {
  let x = 1;
  let y = x + 1;
  x * y + x
};
x + y
```

In this example, the final expression `x + y` has a value of `42`, since it refers to the first declarations of `x` and `y`, prior to the ignored block expression definition. This is because the block expression's declarations do not interfere with the other declarations within the program.

Aside from program clarity, the brief benefit of lexical scoping is program security, since it can be used to build compositionally secure systems. Motoko specifically has very strong composition properties, since nesting programs within another program cannot arbitrarily redefine your variables to have other meanings.

## Defining an actor

In the previous examples, you've just demonstrated syntax using simple declaration and expression lines; however, to encapsulate our code within a smart contract, you need to define an actor that will house the code.

Recall from our previous modules that an actor is *a process with encapsulated state that communicates with other running actors*.

To define an actor, the following syntax is used:

```motoko no-repl
actor {

    //actor code goes here

}
```

This actor definition is empty, meaning it does not define any data or send and receive messages.

So, to take our previous example and encapsulate it within an actor definition, our code would be:

```motoko no-repl
actor {
  let x = 40; let y = 2;
  ignore do {
    let x = 1;
    let y = x + 1;
    x * y + x
  };
  x + y
}
```

## Values and evaluation

In the previous examples, you explored expressions that produced natural numbers (value type `Nat`). There are several other value forms, which you'll dive deeper into now.

### Primitive values

Primitive values are predefined by the language and are named using reserved keywords. In Motoko, the following primitive value forms are available:

- Boolean values (`true` and `false`).

- Integers: `(…​,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …​)`; bounded (finite) and unbounded (infinite) variants.

- Natural numbers: `(0, 1, 2, …​)`; bounded (finite) and unbounded (infinite) variants.

- Text values; strings of Unicode characters.

### Non-primitive values

Additionally, Motoko supports the following user-defined non-primitive value forms and their associated data types:

- Tuples, including the unit value (the "empty tuple").

- Arrays, with both immutable and mutable variants.

- Objects with named, unordered fields and methods.

- Variants with named constructors and optional payload values.

- Function values, including shareable functions.

- Async values; also known as promises or futures.

- Error values that carry the payload of exceptions and system failures.

## Printing values

Earlier, recall that you printed a value using the imported `Debug` library:

```motoko no-repl
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
Debug.print("hello world");
```

The `print` function accepts a text string of type `Text` as the input and returns the unit value of `unit` type or `()` as the output. Unit values do not carry information, as all values of `unit` type or `()` are identical; therefore, the `print` function does not return any interesting result. Instead, the `print` function is able to return the input text string in a human-readable form to your terminal window; this is known as a 'side effect.'.

Functions, such as `print`, that have side effects such as modifying state or returning output, are called 'impure' functions. In contrast, 'pure' functions are functions that only return values and do not provide further 'side effects.'

Next, let's look at transforming a Motoko value into a human-readable text string that can be used for program debugging.

The `debug_show` primitive value permits converting a large class of values into type `Text` values. For example, let's convert three values of type `Text`, `Nat`, and `Text` into human-readable text:

```motoko no-repl
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
Debug.print(debug_show(("hello", 42, "world")))
```

This program, when run, will return:

```bash
("hello", 42, "world")
```

This transformation function can be used to print most Motoko data types as text to be used for debugging.

## Passing text arguments

To wrap things up, let's take a look at how text arguments can be passed into a function. First, consider the following code example:

```motoko no-repl
actor {
public func location(city : Text) : async Text {
    return "Hello, " # city # "!";
};
};
```

In this example, you define a single actor with the function `location`, which accepts a `Text` input for the value of `city`. Then, it returns the output 'Hello, `city`!".

If this example is used in a live canister, the canister can be called, and an input text argument can be passed to the function, such as:

```bash
dfx canister call location_hello_backend location "San Francisco"
```

In this example call, there is a space between 'San' and 'Francisco,' so the argument must be enclosed in quotes. 

:::info
Input passed to a function can be in its plaintext format `"San Francisco"` or in its Candid format `'("San Francisco")'`. 
:::

The output of this canister call will be:

```bash
("Hello, San Francisco!")
```

Alternatively, if no space is used in the argument, it can be passed without quotes, since [Candid](/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/candid/candid-concepts) will infer the data type as `Text`, such as:

```bash
dfx canister call location_hello_backend location Paris
```

The output of this canister call will be:

```bash
("Hello, Paris!")
```
