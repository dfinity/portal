Now that you have <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip> deployed, the next step is to learn how to manage those canisters. Managing a canister includes obtaining the canister's usage information, setting an identity as the canister's controller, and deleting a canister.

## The ICP management canister

The **ICP management canister** exposes management functionality to end users and canisters. While it is titled the 'management canister,' it is not actually a canister that exists with an isolated state, Wasm code, etc., but rather a system API. It is important to know the management canister's role, however, to understand some of the more advanced ICP features, such as threshold ECDSA and the Bitcoin integration.

Management operations such as updating a canister, creating a canister, and stopping or starting a canister are sent to the management canister to be executed. When executed, the messages are sent to the relevant <GlossaryTooltip>subnet</GlossaryTooltip> and intercepted by the execution environment, which triggers the execution of the operation.

You will be building off of the previous module [1.3: Intro to dfx](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.3-intro-dfx). You will need to have followed along and deployed the `hello_world_backend` canister locally to complete this tutorial.

## Obtaining a canister's ID

Each canister has a unique identifier that can be used to interact with the canister. These unique IDs can be used to access the canister's frontend or Candid UI in a web browser, such as when you accessed the frontend of your hello_world dapp in the last tutorial. Having a canister's ID is also important for executing management functions of the canister, such as setting ownership for the canister.

As an example, to get the canister ID of your `hello_world_backend` canister that's been deployed locally, use the command:

```bash
dfx canister id hello_world_backend
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
```

</details>

## Obtaining canister information

Next, to view the canister's controller(s) and the Wasm module hash, use the command:

```bash
dfx canister info hello_world_backend
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
Controllers: bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai x4d3z-ufpaj-lpxs4-v7gmt-v56ze-aub3k-bvifl-y4lsq-soafd-d3i4k-fqe
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

</details>


## Adding an identity as a controller of a canister

To add another identity as an additional controller of the canister, first, let's create a new identity:

```bash
dfx identity new ControllerExample
```

Then, get the <GlossaryTooltip>principal</GlossaryTooltip> value for this new identity with the command:

```bash
dfx identity use ControllerExample
dfx identity get-principal
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae

```

</details>


Copy this value. You'll then use the `dfx canister update-settings` command to add this principal to be a controller of your `hello_world_backend` canister, but first, you need to switch back to your previously created identity, since only existing controllers can add new controllers:

```bash
dfx identity use DeveloperLiftoff
```

Then, use the `dfx canister update-settings` command:

```bash
dfx canister update-settings hello_world_backend --add-controller PRINCIPAL_ID
```

For example, to use your principal value from above:

```bash
dfx canister update-settings hello_world_backend --add-controller lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
```

This command adds the principal `lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae` as an additional controller of your `hello_world_backend` canister. To confirm that this principal has been added, you can run the `dfx canister info` command again:

```bash
dfx canister info hello_world_backend
```

Now you can see this principal listed as a controller:

```
Controllers: bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae x4d3z-ufpaj-lpxs4-v7gmt-v56ze-aub3k-bvifl-y4lsq-soafd-d3i4k-fqe
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

You can remove this principal with the command:

```bash
dfx canister update-settings hello_world_backend --remove-controller PRINCIPAL_ID
```

Alternatively, you can use the `--set-controller` flag instead of the `--add-controller` flag. If any controllers are set using the `--set-controller` flag, any other existing controllers will be removed. For example, re-run the command above, but use the `--set-controller` flag instead:

```bash
dfx canister update-settings hello_world_backend --set-controller lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
```

You will be warned that you'll be removing yourself as a controller since you're setting the `ControllerExample` identity as the sole controller while you're using the `DeveloperLiftoff` identity. Accept this warning.

Then, rerun the `dfx canister info hello_world_backend` command. The output should now be:

```
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

## Managing the running state of a canister

Once a canister has been deployed, it is in a **Running** state and can receive and process requests from other canisters or end users.

Canisters are placed in the **Running** state by default, but there may be situations where a canister needs to be temporarily or permanently stopped. For example, before a canister is upgraded, it may be stopped to ensure proper message handling if a message is in progress or should be rolled back. Stopping a canister is also a requirement if the canister is going to be deleted.

To check the current state of a canister by specifying its name, such as:

```bash
dfx canister status hello_world_backend
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
Canister status call result for hello_world_backend.
Status: Running
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Reserved: 0 Cycles
Reserved Cycles Limit: 5_000_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

</details>

Stopping a canister works in a similar fashion. For example, to stop a canister, run the command:

```bash
dfx canister stop hello_world_backend
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
Stopping code for canister hello_world_backend, with canister_id 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai
```

</details>

Then you can verify that the canister has been stopped by rerunning the `dfx canister status` command:

```bash
dfx canister status hello_world_backend
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
Canister status call result for hello_world_backend.
Status: Stopped
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Reserved: 0 Cycles
Reserved Cycles Limit: 5_000_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

</details>

Then to start the canister again, run the command:

```bash
dfx canister start hello_world_backend
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
Starting code for canister hello_world_backend, with canister_id 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai
```

</details>

## Checking the cycles balance of a canister

To check a canister's <GlossaryTooltip>cycles</GlossaryTooltip> balance, you must be the controller of the canister. The cycles balance can be seen in the output of the `dfx canister status` command, such as:

```bash
dfx canister status hello_world_backend
```

The output will resemble the following, where the value `Balance` refers to the main cycles balance and `Reserved` refers to the reserved cycles balance:

```
Canister status call result for 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai.
Status: Stopped
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Reserved: 0 Cycles
Reserved Cycles Limit: 5_000_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

## Topping up a canister's cycles balance

Depositing cycles into a canister's cycles balance is known as "topping up." For production canisters, which consistently use cycles over time to pay for the canister's resources on the mainnet, topping up the canister is routine maintenance.

While you must be a canister's controller in order to view the cycles balance of the canister, anyone can top up a canister using one of the following methods:

- Using ICP in your account.
- Using the cycles ledger.
- Using the NNS dapp web UI.
- Using a third-party service such as [CycleOps](/docs/building-apps/canister-management/topping-up).

Local development fabricates cycles as needed for canister deployment. To learn about topping up canisters on the mainnet, [read more about how to use ICP or cycles](/docs/building-apps/developing-canisters/deploy#topping-up-canisters).

## Setting the canister's freezing threshold

The freezing threshold is a value defined in seconds, which is used to calculate how many cycles a canister must retain in its cycles balance. This calculation is based off of the canister's memory consumption. The default freezing threshold value is `2_592_000s`, which corresponds to 30 days.

The freezing threshold is important because if a canister runs out of cycles, it will be uninstalled. The freezing threshold protects it from deletion, since if the cycles balance dips below the threshold, the canister will stop processing any new requests; however, it will continue to reply to existing requests.

For example, to set a freezing threshold for your `hello_world_backend` canister, use the command:

```bash
dfx canister update-settings hello_world_backend --freezing-threshold 3472000
```

Then, you can confirm that this threshold has been set by running the `dfx canister status hello_world_backend ` command again:

```
Canister status call result for hello_world_backend.
Status: Stopped
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 3_472_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```


## Deleting a canister

Deleting a canister will withdraw any cycles from that canister and return them to the cycles wallet or cycles ledger account associated with the canister's controller principal. If the canister has multiple controllers, then the principal that made the delete request receives the cycles. When a canister is deleted, the canister's code, state, and canister ID are removed.

Canisters must be stopped before they can be deleted:

```bash
dfx canister stop hello_world_backend
```

Then you can run the command:

```bash
dfx canister delete hello_world_backend
```
