Now that you have <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip> deployed, the next step is to learn how to manage those canisters. Managing a canister includes workflows such as obtaining information, setting an identity as the canister's owner, and deleting a canister. You'll dive into these different workflows and more in this guide to assure that you have the core fundamentals of how to maintain canisters.

## The ICP management canister

To enable canister management, the management canister exposes management functionality to end users and other canisters. While it is titled the 'management canister,' it is not actually a canister that exists with an isolated state, Wasm code, etc.; it is a facade. It is important to understand the management canister's role, however, to understand some of the advanced ICP features, such as threshold ECDSA and integrations like Bitcoin.

Management operations such as updating a canister, creating a canister, and stopping or starting a canister are sent to the management canister and then executed. When executed, the messages are sent to the relevant <GlossaryTooltip>subnet</GlossaryTooltip> and intercepted by the execution environment, which triggers the execution of the operation.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [0.3 Developer environment setup](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-0/dev-env).

You will be building off of the previous three modules, [1.3 Developing your first dapp](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.3-first-dapp), [1.4 Acquiring and using cycles](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.4-using-cycles), and [1.5 Deploying canisters](/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-1/1.5-deploying-canisters). You will need to have followed along and completed the steps outlined in these modules to complete this tutorial.

## Obtaining a canister's ID

Each canister has a unique identifier that can be used to interact with the canister. These unique IDs can be used to access the canister's frontend or Candid UI in a web browser, such as when you accessed the frontend of your poll dapp in the last tutorial. Having a canister's ID is also important for executing management functions of the canister, such as setting ownership for the canister.

As an example, to get the canister ID of your `poll_backend` canister that's been deployed on the mainnet, use the command:

```bash
dfx canister id poll_backend --network ic
```

This command will return the canister's ID, which will look something like this:

```
bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
```

If you want to get the canister ID for a locally deployed canister, simply omit the `--network ic` flag, such as:

```bash
dfx canister id poll_backend
```

:::danger

This tutorial will reference locally deployed canisters from this point forward.

:::

## Obtaining canister information

Next, to obtain some information about your canister, such as the canister's controller(s) and the Wasm module hash, use the command:

```bash
dfx canister info poll_backend
```

The output will be returned, such as:

```
Controllers: bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai x4d3z-ufpaj-lpxs4-v7gmt-v56ze-aub3k-bvifl-y4lsq-soafd-d3i4k-fqe
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

## Adding an identity as a controller of a canister

To add another identity as an additional controller of the canister, first, let's create a new identity:

```bash
dfx identity new ControllerExample
```

Then, get the <GlossaryTooltip>principal</GlossaryTooltip> value for this new identity with the command:

```bash
dfx identity use ControllerExample
dfx identity get-principal
```

The output will resemble the following:

```
lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
```

Copy this value. You'll then use the `dfx canister update-settings` command to add this principal to be a controller of your `poll_backend` canister, but first, you need to switch back to your previously created identity, since only existing controllers can add new controllers:

```bash
dfx identity use DeveloperJourney
```

Then, use the `dfx canister update-settings` command:

```bash
dfx canister update-settings poll_backend --add-controller PRINCIPAL_ID
```

For example, to use your principal value from above:

```bash
dfx canister update-settings poll_backend --add-controller lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
```

This command adds the principal `lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae` as an additional controller of your `poll_backend` canister. To confirm that this principal has been added, you can run the `dfx canister info` command again:

```bash
dfx canister info poll_backend
```

Now you can see this principal listed as a controller:

```
Controllers: bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae x4d3z-ufpaj-lpxs4-v7gmt-v56ze-aub3k-bvifl-y4lsq-soafd-d3i4k-fqe
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

You can remove this principal with the command:

```bash
dfx canister update-settings poll_backend --remove-controller PRINCIPAL_ID
```

Alternatively, you can use the `--set-controller` flag instead of the `--add-controller` flag. If any controllers are set using the `--set-controller` flag, any other existing controllers will be removed. For example, re-run the command above, but use the `--set-controller` flag instead:

```bash
dfx canister update-settings poll_backend --set-controller lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
```

You will be warned that you'll be removing yourself as a controller since you're setting the `ControllerExample` identity as the sole controller while you're using the `DeveloperJourney` identity. Accept this warning.

Then, rerun the `dfx canister info poll_backend` command. The output should now be:

```
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

## Managing the running state of a canister

Once a canister has been deployed, it can receive and process requests from other canisters or end users. When a canister can send requests and receive replies, the canister is in a **Running** state.

Canisters are placed in the **Running** state by default, but there may be situations where a canister needs to be temporarily or permanently stopped. For example, before a canister is upgraded, it may be stopped to ensure proper message handling if the message is in progress or should be rolled back. Stopping a canister is also a requirement if the canister is going to be deleted.

To check the current state of all canisters, you can use the command:

```bash
dfx canister status --all
```

Or, you can check the status of a single canister by specifying its name, such as:

```bash
dfx canister status poll_backend
```

The output of the command will resemble the following:

```
Canister status call result for poll_backend.
Status: Running
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Reserved: 0 Cycles
Reserved Cycles Limit: 5_000_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

Stopping a canister works in a similar fashion. For example, to stop a single canister, run the command:

```bash
dfx canister stop poll_backend
```

Or, to stop all canisters, use the command:

```bash
dfx canister stop --all
```

This command displays output similar to the following:

```
Stopping code for canister poll_backend, with canister_id 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai
Stopping code for canister poll_frontend, with canister_id 5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai
```

Then you can verify that the canisters have been stopped by rerunning the `dfx canister status` command:

```bash
dfx canister status poll_backend
```

Which should return:

```
Canister status call result for poll_backend.
Status: Stopped
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Reserved: 0 Cycles
Reserved Cycles Limit: 5_000_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

Then to start the canister again, run the command:

```bash
dfx canister start --all
```

This will return a confirmation such as:

```
Starting code for canister poll_backend, with canister_id 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai
Starting code for canister poll_frontend, with canister_id 5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai
```

## Checking the cycles balance of a canister

To check a canister's <GlossaryTooltip>cycles</GlossaryTooltip> balance, you must be the controller of the canister. The cycles balance can be seen in the output of the `dfx canister status` command, such as:

```bash
dfx canister status poll_backend
```

The output will resemble the following, where the value `Balance` refers to the main cycles balance and `Reserved` refers to the reserved cycles balance:

```
Canister status call result for 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai.
Status: Stopped
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Reserved: 0 Cycles
Reserved Cycles Limit: 5_000_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

## Topping up a canister's cycles balance

Depositing cycles into a canister's cycles balance is known as 'topping up' the canister's balance. For production canisters, which consistently use cycles over time to pay for the canister's resources, topping up the canister is required for routine maintenance.

While you must be a canister's controller in order to view the cycles balance of the canister, anyone can top up a canister.

There are a few ways to top up a canister:

- Using ICP in your account.
- Using the cycles ledger.
- Using the NNS dapp web UI.
- Using a third-party service such as [CycleOps](/docs/building-apps/canister-management/topping-up).

Local development fabricates cycles as needed for canister deployment. To learn about topping up canisters on the mainnet, [read more about how to use ICP or cycles](/docs/building-apps/developing-canisters/deploy#topping-up-canisters).

## Setting the canister's freezing threshold

In the output of the `dfx canister status` command, you may have noticed the `freezing threshold` value. The freezing threshold is a value defined in seconds, which is used to calculate how many cycles a canister must retain in its cycles balance. This calculation is based off of the canister's memory consumption. The default freezing threshold value is `2_592_000s`, which corresponds to 30 days.

The freezing threshold is important because if a canister runs out of cycles, it will be uninstalled. The freezing threshold protects it from deletion, since if the cycles balance dips below the threshold, the canister will stop processing any new requests; however, it will continue to reply to existing requests.

For example, to set a freezing threshold for your `poll_backend` canister, use the command:

```bash
dfx canister update-settings poll_backend --freezing-threshold 3472000
```

Then, you can confirm that this threshold has been set by running the `dfx canister status poll_backend ` command again:

```
Canister status call result for poll_backend.
Status: Stopped
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 3_472_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```


## Deleting a canister

The last portion of canister management that will be covered in this guide is deleting canisters. Deleting a canister will withdraw any cycles from that canister and return them to the identity associated with the canister's controller principal.

To delete a single canister, first you need to stop the canister with the command:

```bash
dfx canister stop poll_backend
```

Then you can run the command:

```bash
dfx canister delete poll_backend
```

When a canister is deleted, the canister's code, state, and canister ID are removed. Canisters must be stopped before they can be deleted. Alternatively, all canisters for a project can be deleted with the commands:

```bash
dfx canister stop  --all
dfx canister delete  --all
```
