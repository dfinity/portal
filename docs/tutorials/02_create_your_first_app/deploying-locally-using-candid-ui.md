# Step 4 - Deploying locally and using Candid UI

In this article we will learn how to deploy our app locally and play with it using Candid UI.

## Starting local Internet Computer server

Before you can deploy your app, you need to start a local Internet Computer server to host the app code. To do so, open
the terminal and type this command:

```bash
dfx start --background
```

You will a result in the console similar to this:

## Deploying your app

To deploy your app you need to:

1. Change your current directory to the project root
2. Type `dfx deploy` in the command line

Example output in the console:
![dfx deploy screenshot](./_attachments/dfx_deploy.webp)

## Opening Candid UI

When you deployed your canister, the system displays two lines similar to this:

```shell
URLs:
  Frontend canister via browser
    poll2_frontend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=rno2w-sqaaa-aaaaa-aaacq-cai
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    poll2_backend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=renrk-eyaaa-aaaaa-aaada-cai&id=rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai
```

You will need the second URL (for `poll2_backend`) to access candid UI. Open this URL to your web browser to open the
Candid UI web page. You should we something like this:

## Using Candid UI to access the data

As you can see, Candid UI allows you to access the methods of the actor that we coded at the previosus step.

You can play with your implementation by calling methods and see that the question is stored and retrieved correctly:

## Summary

During this step we learned:

- How to start the local Internet Computer environment
- How to deploy canisters to the local environment
- How to use Candid UI to quickly test your code

In the next section we will make the app much more complex by adding voting options.
