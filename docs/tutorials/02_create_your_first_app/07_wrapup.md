# Conclusion

#### **ðŸŽ‰ You are done! ðŸŽ‰**

You have built a dapp fully on-chain (both backend and frontend).

## Deploying to Mainnet

If you would like to deploy this dapp to mainnet, you can follow the same steps in the first tutorial: [Deploy a dapp on-chain](../deploy_sample_app/#deploying-on-chain).

## Tutorial takeaways

* ICP dapps can host backend and frontend logic.
* ICP canister smart contracts can host data, which can be queried and manipulated.
* [IC SDK](../../developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx) comes with default projects with frontend and backend canister smart contracts.
* IC SDK comes with Candid UI so developers can interact with backend canister smart contracts.
* Motoko can be used for building backend canister smart contracts.
