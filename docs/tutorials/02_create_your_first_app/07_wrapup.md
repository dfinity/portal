# Conclusion

**ðŸŽ‰ You are done! ðŸŽ‰**

You have built a dapp fully on-chain with both backend and frontend components.

## Deploying to the mainnet

If you would like to deploy this dapp to the mainnet, you can follow the same steps in the first tutorial: [deploy a dapp on-chain](../deploy_sample_app/#deploying-on-chain).

## Tutorial takeaways

* ICP dapps can host backend and frontend logic.
* ICP canister smart contracts can host data, which can be queried and manipulated.
* [The IC SDK](../../developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx) comes with default projects with frontend and backend canister smart contracts.
* The IC SDK comes with the Candid UI so developers can interact with backend canister smart contracts.
* Motoko can be used for building backend canister smart contracts.
