# Using ckBTC in dapps

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Bitcoin", "Chain-key tokens" ]} />

ckBTC can be integrated into dapps in several ways. Integration may target the dapp developer’s own canisters or the end users of the application. The main options are:
- allowing clients to interact with the ckBTC ledger directly,
- enabling a canister to interact with the ckBTC ledger (for its own use or to manage user funds), and
- supporting Bitcoin ↔ ckBTC conversion for deposits and withdrawals.

## Ledger interaction

The [ckBTC ledger](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai) implements the [ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md) and [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-2/README.md) token standards.
This means that integration with the ledger involves calling the standard endpoints for actions such as:

- `icrc1_balance_of` to fetch balances,  
- `icrc1_transfer` to transfer tokens, and
- `icrc2_approve` / `icrc2_transfer_from` for delegated transfers.

There are two primary ways to interact with the ckBTC ledger:

### Client calls (via agent)
A client application (e.g. web application) can use an [agent](/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/agents/overview) to interact directly with the ckBTC ledger canister.

An **agent** is the API client layer used to call ICP canisters. For example, the [ICP JavaScript agent](/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/agents/javascript-agent) can create an actor from the ledger’s [Candid interface](/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/candid/candid-concepts) to invoke its endpoints.

The following libraries simplify creating actors for the ckBTC ledger:

- Rust: [icrc-ledger-agent](https://crates.io/crates/icrc-ledger-agent)
- TypeScript: [@dfinity/ledger-icrc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/ledger-icrc)

In this model, all transactions are signed by the user’s [account](/docs/defi/token-standards/#accounts-principals-and-subaccounts).

### Inter-canister calls
A canister can also interact with the ckBTC ledger.

- In some cases, the canister may use ckBTC for its own purposes, such as making payments to other canisters, managing a treasury, or executing automated transfers.
- In other cases, the canister may act on behalf of users, which requires managing user funds. This can be achieved by creating **subaccounts per user** or by **pooling all funds in a single account** and maintaining an internal balance table.
  - It is recommended to use the [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-2/README.md) approval flow (`icrc2_approve` / `icrc2_transfer_from`) to move funds from a user’s wallet to the backend canister.

Libraries are available to simplify inter-canister calls:

- Rust: [icrc-ledger-client-cdk](https://crates.io/crates/icrc-ledger-client-cdk)
- Motoko: [icrc2-types](https://mops.one/icrc2-types) (includes ICRC-1 types)

Example code:
- Motoko: [transfer](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/token_transfer), [transfer_from](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/token_transfer_from)
- Rust: [transfer](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/token_transfer), [transfer_from](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/token_transfer_from)

## Bitcoin ↔ ckBTC conversion

Beyond ledger interactions, a dapp may also support minting and burning ckBTC by calling the [ckBTC minter canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mqygn-kiaaa-aaaar-qaadq-cai).

This can be done in two ways:

- **Client calls (via agent)**
  - Any client can call the ckBTC minter canister directly.
  - TypeScript library: [@dfinity/ckbtc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/ckbtc)

- **Inter-canister calls**
  - A backend canister can call the ckBTC minter canister as part of its logic, either for its own use or on behalf of users.

Check out the [ckBTC API](/docs/references/ckbtc-reference) and learn more about implementing this conversion flow in the [ckBTC best practices](/docs/defi/defi-best-practices).

### Why integrate conversion into a dapp
- Enables deposits from Bitcoin → ckBTC and withdrawals from ckBTC → Bitcoin without leaving the application.
- Reduces friction and improves overall user experience.

**Note:** Applications that integrate with [OISY](https://oisy.com) may rely on OISY to handle Bitcoin ↔ ckBTC conversion on behalf of their users, instead of implementing the conversion themselves.
