# Making ckERC20 transactions

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Ethereum", "Chain-key tokens"]} />

There are several different ways to interact with ckERC20 tokens:

- Converting ckERC20 to ERC-20 tokens
- Converting ERC-20 to ckERC20 tokens
- Transferring ckERC20 tokens
- Viewing ckERC20 token transactions

## Converting ERC-20 tokens to ckERC20 tokens

The list of supported ckERC20 tokens can be obtained by running the following command:

```
dfx canister --ic call sv3dd-oaaaa-aaaar-qacoa-cai get_minter_info
```

:::info

Note that ERC-20 tokens can only be converted if the ICRC ledger suite for the
corresponding ckERC20 token exists.

:::

The return value contains a vector, `supported_ckerc20_tokens`, which lists all ckERC20 tokens.
The return value also contains the field `erc20_helper_contract_address`, which states the **helper smart contract** address on Ethereum used in the conversion flows.

The ckERC20 helper contract addresses can be found below:

|Ethereum chain |Helper smart contract |
|---------------|----------------------|
|[Ethereum Mainnet](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains/blob/master/_data/chains/eip155-1.json)|[0x6abDA0438307733FC299e9C229FD3cc074bD8cC0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6abDA0438307733FC299e9C229FD3cc074bD8cC0)|
|[Ethereum Testnet Sepolia](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains/blob/master/_data/chains/eip155-11155111.json)|[0x674Cdbe64Df412DA9bAb1596e00c1520979B5A23](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x674Cdbe64Df412DA9bAb1596e00c1520979B5A23)|

:::info

Note that the helper smart contract might change. It is therefore recommended to request the ckETH minter info and extract the helper smart contract address from the response to assure you have the latest contract address.

:::


If the targeted ckERC20 token is listed, [download the ckETH repository](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/ethereum/cketh). Then, navigate into the subdirectory for either the mainnet (`ic/rs/ethereum/cketh/mainnet`) or testnet (`ic/rs/ethereum/cketh/testnet`).

Create an Ethereum transaction that calls the `approve` function on the corresponding ERC-20 contract address, allowing the helper smart contract to withdraw some of the user's funds.

The next step is to call the `deposit` function of the helper smart contract, specifying the ERC-20 smart contract address, the amount to be deposited, and the principal ID that should be credited for the deposit. The principal ID must be encoded as a `bytes32` array. A convenient way to obtain the correct encoding is to use the `Principal → Bytes32 conversion` function on the ckETH minter [dashboard](https://sv3dd-oaaaa-aaaar-qacoa-cai.raw.icp0.io/dashboard).

:::warning

If your encoded principal ID is incorrect, funds will be lost.

:::

No further user action is required. The `icrc1_balance_of` function can be called on the corresponding ckERC20 ledger to check if the ckERC20 tokens have been minted, which usually takes about 20 minutes.


## Converting ckERC20 tokens to ERC-20 tokens

Since the user must pay the transaction fees, the `icrc2_approve` function must be called on the ckETH ledger, allowing the ckETH minter to spend some of the user's ckETH tokens.
For example, the following command approves the ckETH minter to take up to 1 ckETH from the user's account.

```
dfx canister --ic call ledger icrc2_approve "(record { spender = record { owner = principal \"$(dfx canister id minter --ic)\" }; amount = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000:nat })"
```

The user must further approve the ckETH minter to transfer the desired amount of the targeted ckERC20 token:

```
dfx canister --ic call CKERC20_LEDGER icrc2_approve "(record { spender = record { owner = principal \"$(dfx canister id minter --ic)\" }; amount = CKERC20_TOKEN_AMOUNT:nat })"
```

The placeholder `CKERC20_LEDGER` must be replaced by the canister ID of the corresponding ckERC20 ledger, and `CKERC20_TOKEN_AMOUNT` must be replaced by the desired amount, denominated in the smallest unit of the token. For example, USDC and ckUSDC use 6 decimals, so 1 USDC must be written as `1_000_000`.

The last step is to call the `withdraw_erc20` function on the ckETH minter as follows.

```
dfx canister --ic call minter withdraw_erc20 "(record { amount = CKERC20_TOKEN_AMOUNT:nat; ckerc20_ledger_id = principal \"CKERC20_LEDGER\"; recipient = \"ETH_ADDRESS\"})"
```

As before, `CKERC20_TOKEN_AMOUNT` and `CKERC20_LEDGER` must be replaced by the desired amount in the smallest unit and the canister ID of the ckERC20 ledger, respectively.
Lastly, `ETH_ADDRESS` must be replaced by the desired Ethereum destination address.

## Transferring ckERC20 tokens

ckERC20 tokens are ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 compliant and can therefore be transferred by calling the `icrc1_transfer` function.

```
dfx canister --ic call CKERC20_LEDGER "(record { to = DESTINATION_ACCOUNT; amount = AMOUNT:nat})"
```

The placeholders `CKERC20_LEDGER`, `DESTINATION_ACCOUNT`, and `AMOUNT` must be replaced by the canister ID of the targeted ckERC20 ledger, the destination account, and the desired amount, respectively. More information about the `icrc1_transfer` function can be found in the [ICRC-1 standard specification](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-1).

:::info

Transferring ckERC20 tokens incurs a small fee. The exact amount depends on the specific ckERC20 token. The transfer fee can be obtained by calling the `icrc1_metadata` function on the ckERC20 ledger. The response contains the fee under the key `icrc1:fee`.

## Viewing ckERC20 token transactions

The Internet Computer dashboard shows the transactions of all ckERC20 tokens:

- [ckUSDC transactions](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/ethereum/xevnm-gaaaa-aaaar-qafnq-cai/transactions)

- [ckLINK transactions](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/ethereum/g4tto-rqaaa-aaaar-qageq-cai/transactions)

- [ckPEPE transactions](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/ethereum/etik7-oiaaa-aaaar-qagia-cai)

- [ckOCT transactions](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/ethereum/ebo5g-cyaaa-aaaar-qagla-cai)

Alternatively, the history of transactions can be obtained from the index canister of the ckERC20 ledger suite.
The following command can be used to retrieve the canister IDs of all canisters in the ledger suite of a particular ckERC20 token.

```
dfx canister --network ic call LSO canister_ids "(record { chain_id = CHAIN_ID:nat; address = "ERC_20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"})"
```


Replace the following values:

- `LSO`: The canister ID of the ledger suite orchestrator associated with the targeted Ethereum network (`vxkom-oyaaa-aaaar-qafda-cai` for Ethereum mainnet).

- `CHAIN_ID`: The chain ID of the targeted Ethereum network (`chain_id = 1` for Ethereum mainnet).

- `ERC_20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The corresponding ERC-20 smart contract address (`address = "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"` for USDC).
