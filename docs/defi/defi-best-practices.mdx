# Token best practices

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Best practices"]} />

When developing applications that utilize tokens, or when deploying your own token, consider the following best practices.

## Creating a token

### Recommendation: Choose the token standard that best fits your needs.

- For basic fungible tokens, use ICRC-1.

- For fungible tokens that support the approve and transfer functionality, implement ICRC-2.

- For non-fungible tokens (NFTs) ICRC-7 or ICRC-37. ICRC-37 supports the approve and transfer functionality.

### Recommendation: Include appropriate metadata for your token.

Better metadata results in a better user experience and wallet integration. [Learn more about metadata](/docs/tutorials/hackathon-prep-course/integrating-with-tokens#icrc-1-tokens).

## Transaction deduplication

### Recommendation: Use the `created_at_time` and `memo` parameters to make transaction calls [idempotent](/docs/building-apps/best-practices/idempotency#id-deduplication).

### Recommendation: Implement a time window for deduplication using the ICRC configuration parameter `TX_WINDOW`.

### Recommendation: Consider capacity limits for your deduplication store.

There is a limit for the number of deduplicated transactions that can be stored in the [deduplication store](/docs/building-apps/best-practices/idempotency#id-deduplication). Transactions are rejected once this store is full until older transactions expire at the end of the time window.

## Embedding standards into existing ledgers

### Recommendation: Utilize flexibility when choosing internal account representations.

### Recommendation: Use `icrc1_` as the prefix for all methods to prevent conflicts.

### Recommendation: Handle transaction logs appropriately.

## Inter-canister call considerations

### Recommendation: Fully test inter-canister calls and rollbacks.

Issues with [inter-canister calls](/docs/building-apps/security/overview) can lead to time-of-check, time-of-use, or double spending security bugs.

### Recommendation: Certify query responses if they are relevant for security.

This is important when displaying important financial data to the user that may be used to make decisions on future transactions.

## Controllers

### Recommendation: Use a decentralized governance system like SNS.

Decentralizing control is a fundamental aspect of decentralized finance applications.

## ckBTC best practices: Write a smart contract that mints and burns ckBTC

When building dapps where users can deposit bitcoin to receive ckBTC or burn ckBTC to withdraw bitcoin, developers are advised to adhere to the following best practices.

In order to mint ckBTC, the user must first deposit bitcoin into the Bitcoin address returned by the endpoint `get_btc_address`, which is tied to the user's principal ID and possibly a subaccount.

Next, the user should issue query calls to the `bitcoin_get_utxos_query` endpoint of the [Bitcoin canister](https://github.com/dfinity/bitcoin-canister) to retrieve the unspent outputs of the Bitcoin address obtained in the first step.
If the user does not know for which unspent outputs ckBTC has already been minted, the `get_known_utxos` query endpoint can be called on the ckBTC minter, returning the known unspent outputs for the Bitcoin address derived from the user's principal ID (and possibly a subaccount).

If there is an unspent output that the ckBTC minter has not seen yet, the user can issue an update call to the `update_balance` endpoint on the ckBTC minter. The ckBTC minter will then mint ckBTC for each newly discovered unspent output.

The recommended mechanism to withdraw bitcoin is to first create an [ICRC-2 approval](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-2/README.md#icrc2_approve) by calling the `icrc2_approve` endpoint on the ckBTC ledger, authorizing the ckBTC minter (canister ID: `mqygn-kiaaa-aaaar-qaadq-cai`) to retrieve at least the amount that is to be withdrawn. After that, the user can call the `retrieve_btc_with_approval` endpoint on the ckBTC minter, which will create a transaction to burn the specified amount in ckBTC. When this operation succeeds, the ckBTC minter will then create a Bitcoin transaction to withdraw the corresponding amount in bitcoin to the user's specified Bitcoin address.
