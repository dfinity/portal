# Launch a token

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tokens"]} />

Custom fungible tokens can be created and deployed on ICP using the [ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-1) or [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-2) token standards. Non-fungible tokens can be created using the [ICRC-7](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/tree/main/ICRCs/ICRC-7) or [ICRC-37](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/tree/main/ICRCs/ICRC-37) standards.

The ICRC-1 standard is considered the 'base' standard, as it defines a set of general functionalities and requirements that all tokens and their corresponding ledgers must fulfill. Read about [token standards](/defi/token-standards/) to learn more about what token standards are and the functionalities each one supports.

## Checklist: How to create a fungible token

1. Determine your token's name, symbol, and tokenomics.
2. Refer to the [token best practices](/defi/defi-best-practices) and [security best practices](/building-apps/security/overview) to educate yourself on the precautions you should take when developing a DeFi asset.
3. Create or determine the [developer identity](/building-apps/getting-started/identities) that will act as the token's minter account.
4. Create or determine the [developer identity](/building-apps/getting-started/identities) that will act as the controller ID for the ledger canister.
5. Setup a local [ICRC-1 ledger](/defi/token-ledgers/setup/icrc1_ledger_setup).
6. [Initialize your token's settings](/defi/token-ledgers/usage/icrc1_ledger_usage).
7. Determine if your token will support approval workflows and if so, [enable ICRC-2 methods](/defi/token-ledgers/usage/icrc1_ledger_usage#ICRC2).
8. Configure archive options.
9. Deploy your token locally and test.
10. Deploy your token to the mainnet for production use.
