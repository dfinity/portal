# Create a token

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tokens"]} />

Custom fungible tokens can be created and deployed on ICP using the [ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-1) or [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-2) token standards. Non-fungible tokens can be created using the [ICRC-7](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/tree/main/ICRCs/ICRC-7) and [ICRC-37](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/tree/main/ICRCs/ICRC-37) standards.

The ICRC-1 standard is considered the 'base' standard, as it defines a set of general functionalities that all ledgers must adhere to. Any tokens and their corresponding ledgers must fulfill all requirements of the ICRC-1 standard. Read about [token standards](/docs/defi/token-standards/) to learn more about what token standards are and the functionalities each one supports.

This guide will provide a quickstart on how you can create and deploy your own custom token using the ICRC-1 standard.

## Set up a local ICRC-1 ledger

To create a new ICRC-1 token, you will need to first download and configure a local project for the ICRC-1 <GlossaryTooltip>ledger</GlossaryTooltip> <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>. This is because each token will need its own ledger canister to record the token's balances and transactions. [Follow the ICRC-1 ledger documentation for instructions](/docs/defi/token-ledgers/setup/icrc1_ledger_setup).

## Export token settings

:::info
The initialization arguments of the ICRC-1 ledger are not specified in the [standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md). Thus, the arguments defined in this section are dependent on the reference implementation of the ICRC-1 ledger. If you build your own ICRC-1 ledger, you may use different initialization arguments.
:::

To create a token, you will need to record several values. The full list can be found below:

#### `PRE_MINTED_TOKENS`

Amount of tokens that are minted during deployment for a specific account. In this tutorial, it will be the `DEFAULT` account.

```
dfx identity use default
echo $(dfx identity get-principal)
```

#### `TRANSFER_FEE`

Fee that users of the ledger will have to pay anytime they want to make a transfer.

#### `TOKEN_NAME`

The name of your token.

#### `TOKEN_SYMBOL`

The ticker symbol of your new token.

#### `MINTER`

The account of the principal responsible for minting and burning tokens (see the [ICRC-1 specification](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1)). Transfers from the minting account will generate `Mint` transactions, resulting in the creation of new tokens. To mint tokens, the minting account must call the `icrc1_transfer` function, specifying the recipient in the 'to' value.

Transfers sent to the minting account will generate `Burn` transactions, destroying tokens. An `icrc1_transfer` call from any principal with the 'to' value set as the minting account will burn tokens.

```
dfx identity new minter
dfx identity use minter
echo $(dfx identity get-principal)
```

#### `FEATURE_FLAGS`

A flag for enabling or disabling certain extension standards to the ICRC-1 standard. In this case, the reference implementation can also support ICRC-2 transactions.

If you only want to support the ICRC-1 standard, then you can set the flag to `false`. If you want to also support the ICRC-2 standard, set it to `true`.

### Archive options

The following options configure the archiving settings of the ledger.
In case optional fields are not specified, [the default values defined in `ArchiveOptions::new`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/396b461cd018448b075c82afac1b3a45b9a3dc1a/rs/ledger_suite/common/ledger_canister_core/src/archive.rs#L160-L176) are used.
For production deployments, it is recommended to set the values [similarly to what is done for SNS ledgers](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/98fa250f488163fc5d94079c4acd81ba55761bd6/rs/sns/init/src/lib.rs#L600-L613).

#### `CONTROLLER_ID`

The [controller <GlossaryTooltip>principal</GlossaryTooltip>](/docs/defi/token-ledgers/cycles-ledger) of the archive canisters.

```
dfx identity new archive_controller
dfx identity use archive_controller
echo $(dfx identity get-principal)
```

#### `TRIGGER_THRESHOLD`

The number of blocks to archive when the trigger threshold is exceeded.

#### `CYCLES_FOR_ARCHIVE_CREATION`

The number of cycles that will be sent to the archive canister when it is created.
Note that this needs to cover [the cost for canister creation](/docs/building-apps/essentials/gas-cost), and the installation of the canister.
If the value is set too low, archiving is effectively disabled.

#### `NUM_BLOCKS_TO_ARCHIVE`

The number of blocks that will be archived.
If this is set to zero, archiving is effectively disabled.

## Edit the project's dfx.json file

Replace the existing content in the `dfx.json` with the following, updating the values of `TOKEN_SYMBOL`, `TOKEN_NAME`, `MINTER`, `TRANSFER_FEE`, `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID`, `PRE_MINTED_TOKENS`, `NUM_OF_BLOCKS_TO_ARCHIVE`, `TRIGGER_THRESHOLD`, and `ARCHIVE_CONTROLLER` with the values obtained in the previous steps:

:::info
`dfx.json` does not support referring to values through environment variables. Values must be hardcoded in plain text.
:::

```json
{
    "canisters": {
        "icrc1_ledger_canister": {
            "type": "custom",
            "candid": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/<REVISION>/rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did",
            "wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/<REVISION>/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz",
            "init_arg": "(variant {Init = record { token_symbol = "TOKEN_SYMBOL"; token_name = "TOKEN_NAME"; minting_account = record { owner = principal "MINTER" transfer_fee = TRANSFER_FEE; metadata = vec {}; feature_flags = opt record{icrc2 = false}; initial_balances = vec { record { record { owner = principal "DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID"; }; "PRE_MINTED_TOKENS"; }; }; archive_options = record { num_blocks_to_archive = "NUM_OF_BLOCK_TO_ARCHIVE"; trigger_threshold = "TRIGGER_THRESHOLD"; controller_id = principal "ARCHIVE_CONTROLLER"; cycles_for_archive_creation = opt "10000000000000"; }; }} })" },
            },
    "defaults": {
        "build": {
            "args": "",
            "packtool": ""
        }
        },
    "output_env_file": ".env",
    "version": 1
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass these init arguments to the canister through the command line. [Learn more about canister init arguments](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/advanced-dfx/init-args).

## Deploy the ledger locally

:::caution
Deploying to the playground is ICP's equivalent of deploying to a testnet network.

In this workflow, you cannot deploy this canister to the playground (using the flag `dfx deploy --playground`) because it does not accept gzipped Wasm files.
:::

Deploy the ICRC-1 ledger canister locally and pass in the arguments to create your token.

``` sh
dfx start --clean --background
dfx deploy icrc1_ledger_canister --specified-id mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai
```

For additional details, you can learn more in the [ICRC-1 ledger documentation](/docs/defi/token-ledgers/setup/icrc1_ledger_setup).

Your token has been created locally. To interact with your token, [learn how to interact with the ICRC-1 ledger](/docs/defi/token-indexes/).

## Deploying your token to the mainnet

If you want to deploy your ICRC-1 token on the mainnet, follow these steps:

- Remove the `--specified-id` flag. Your ledger canister will receive a unique canister ID when deployed on the mainnet.

- Specify the initially minted token value by setting `initial_values = vec {<INITIAL_VALUES>}`. View the `ledger.did` file for the details of the argument.

- Add the `--network ic` flag to the command to deploy to the mainnet.

- Confirm that the `archive_options` field is set. If archiving is disabled, your ledger's memory capacity will be limited to that of a single canister.

- Be sure that your ledger canister has cycles attached to the `create_canister` messages, using the `cycles_for_archive_creation`.

## Changing your token metadata

:::info
The initialization and upgrade arguments of the ICRC-1 ledger are not specified in the [standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md). Thus, the arguments defined in this section are dependent on the reference implementation of the ICRC-1 ledger. If you build your own ICRC-1 ledger, you may use different initialization arguments.
:::

Token metadata, such as the token name, symbol, and logo, is set using the [`InitArgs`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/ad6df00098cf25d8df29a469c0a4504979a411c1/rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/ledger/src/lib.rs#L253-L266) when the ledger is installed.
This metadata can subsequently be changed using the [`UpgradeArgs`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/ad6df00098cf25d8df29a469c0a4504979a411c1/rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/ledger/src/lib.rs#L324-L342) when the ledger is upgraded.
Note that such an upgrade can also be performed by upgrading the ledger canister to the same Wasm that it is currently running, which results in the metadata being changed, but the functional behavior of the ledger otherwise remaining the same.

The reference implementation of the ICRC-1 ledger interprets some metadata, whereas other metadata is simply stored and returned in the response to an `icrc1_metadata` query.
The former covers the following:

- The token name.

- The token symbol.

- The number of decimals.

- The transaction fee.

The above values should be set using the explicitly provided fields in the `InitArgs` or `UpgradeArgs`, for canister installs or upgrades, respectively, e.g., the `token_symbol` field for setting the token symbol.
Other metadata, such as the token logo, should be set as `(key, value)` pairs in the `metadata` `Vec`.
The format **should** follow what is specified in the [standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-1#metadata), e.g., for the token logo, the metadata key should be `icrc1:logo`.
