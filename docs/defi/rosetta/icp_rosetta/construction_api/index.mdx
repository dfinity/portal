# ICP Rosetta construction API

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Rosetta" ]} />

The construction API allows for offline signing of transactions, then posting them on ICP at a later point in time.

In general, the construction API of Rosetta supports three categories of transaction types:
- [Transferring assets](/docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/operations-flow): This is the most basic functionality. In accordance with the ICRC-1 standard, you can use Rosetta to transfer ICP.
- [Staking and neuron management](/docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/staking): To be able to stake your ICP and earn rewards for taking part in the voting mechanism of the NNS, you will need to create a neuron and configure it so it fits your personal preferences.
- [Voting and following](/docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/voting): To gain rewards in the form of maturity, you will need to take part in the voting on the NNS or follow existing neurons.
