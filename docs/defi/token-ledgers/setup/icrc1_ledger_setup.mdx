# ICRC-1 ledger local setup

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate" , "Ledgers"]} />

ICRC-1 is a [token standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1) used to create and deploy fungible tokens on the Internet Computer. Each token deployed on the network has its own dedicated ledger. Thus, deploying a new token that is ICRC-1-compatible is synonymous with deploying an ICRC-1 ledger.

The ICRC-1 ledger used in this guide is a reference implementation used to demonstrate how to set up an existing ICRC-1 ledger implementation rather than how to build an ICRC-1 ledger yourself.

- #### Step 1: Create a new `dfx` project or open an existing project.

- #### Step 2: Obtain the latest ledger Wasm and Candid files.

Search for [ledger-suite-icrc releases](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/releases?q="ledger-suite-icrc"&expanded=false) and select the latest ICRC ledger suite release.

The URL for the ledger Wasm module is `https://github.com/dfinity/ic/releases/download/<RELEASE>/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz`.

The URL for the ledger Candid file is `https://github.com/dfinity/ic/releases/download/<RELEASE>/ledger.did`.

#### Optional
If you want to make sure you have the latest ICRC-1 ledger files, you can run the following script that downloads the files into your local directory:

``` sh
curl -o download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/69988ae40e4cc0db7ef758da7dd5c0606075e926/rs/rosetta-api/scripts/download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh"
chmod +x download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh
./download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh
```

- #### Step 4: Configure the `dfx.json` file.

Open the `dfx.json` file in your project's directory. Replace the existing content with the following and make sure you replace `<RELEASE>` in the `candid` and `wasm` URLs as shown in the previous step:

``` json
{
  "canisters": {
    "icrc1_ledger_canister": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://github.com/dfinity/ic/releases/download/<RELEASE>/ledger.did",
      "wasm": "https://github.com/dfinity/ic/releases/download/<RELEASE>/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "args": "",
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env",
  "version": 1
}
```

Optionally, you can include the ledger canister's init arguments in this `dfx.json` file. [Learn more about init args](/docs/defi/create).

If you chose to download the ICRC-1 ledger files with the script, you need to replace the Candid and Wasm file entries with the path to the files:

``` json
...
"candid": "icrc1_ledger.did",
"wasm" : "icrc1_ledger.wasm.gz"
  ...
```

:::info
In an existing project you would only need to add the `icrc1_ledger_canister` canister to the `canisters` section instead of replacing the entire content of `dfx.json`.

## Ledger test suite

There is a test suite available for [ICRC-1 ledgers](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/test). If you are building your own ICRC-1 repository, it might be helpful to run this test suite against your locally deployed ICRC-1 ledger or import the test suite directly through a Rust crate and add the tests to your repository. You can find a reference implementation of integrating the [test suite to your repo](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/test/ref).
