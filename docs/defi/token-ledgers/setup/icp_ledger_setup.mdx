# ICP ledger local setup

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate" , "Ledgers"]} />

The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) implements management of its utility token (ticker "ICP") using a specialized canister, called the **ICP ledger canister**. It is a single ledger canister that runs alongside other canisters on a special subnet of the Internet Computer—the NNS subnet. The ICP ledger canister is a smart contract that holds **blocks**, each containing a single transaction.

These transactions are either:

- **Mint ICP tokens** for accounts.

- **Transfer ICP tokens** from one account to another.

- **Burn ICP tokens** eliminating them from existence.

- **Approve ICP tokens** to be spent by some other `AccountIdentifier`.

- **Transfer ICP from** a previously approved `AccountIdentifier`.

All operations are recorded as transactions in the ledger canister.

The ICP ledger canister maintains a traceable history of all transactions, starting from its genesis state (initial state).

Each new transaction is placed into a block, and each block is associated with a monotonically increasing unique index. The entire chain is regularly signed by the network. The signature used to authenticate the chain can be verified by any third party who has access to the root public key of the Internet Computer. Specific transactions can be retrieved by querying the ICP ledger for blocks.

If you are working in a local development environment, i.e., with a local development environment instead of the public Internet Computer, you can't access the ICP ledger running on the mainnet. In order to test your application that integrates with the ICP ledger locally, you need to deploy a local ledger canister or install the NNS locally through dfx. However, this local ledger canister won't have the history and balances of the live ICP ledger.

## Architecture

### Accounts

An ICP ledger account (see [ICRC-1 standard](/docs/defi/token-standards/#icrc-1)) belongs to and is controlled by the account owner, who must have a valid principal ID. No account can be owned by two or more principals (no "joint accounts"). However, since a principal can refer to an external user as well as to a canister, joint accounts can be implemented as canisters.

An account on the ledger is represented and stored as an `AccountIdentifier`, which is derived from the principal ID and subaccount identifier by computing a hash of the two. The subaccount is an optional bitstring that helps distinguish between the different subaccounts of the same owner.

In this context, you can think of principal identifiers as a rough equivalent to the hash of a user’s public key for Bitcoin or Ethereum. You use the corresponding secret key to sign messages and therefore authenticate to the ledger canister and operate on the principal’s account. Canisters can also have accounts in the ledger canister, in which case the address is derived from the canister’s principal.

:::info Why does the ledger use `AccountIdentifier`s and not just principal IDs?

The main reason for introducing accounts was to allow a principal to control multiple accounts. While this could be abstracted away for a user by the wallet software, this is not possible for canisters.

## Deploying the ledger locally

There are two ways of deploying an ICP ledger locally:

1. Use [`dfx nns`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-nns) to deploy the entire NNS locally. Since the ICP ledger is part of the NNS, this command will also install an ICP ledger with canister ID `ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai`. This solution is fast and straightforward, but also more heavyweight.

2. Deploy the ICP ledger locally using the canister's Wasm file. This method is discussed and demonstrated in this guide, as it gives you more control over the deployment and is lightweight.

Deploying an ICP ledger locally using the Wasm or `.did` files gives you certain advantages over the default ledger from `dfx` that is installed with `dfx nns install`. For instance, you can define the `minting account`, you have control over the initialization arguments, and you have control over which Wasm version of the ICP ledger you want to interact with.

The ICP ledger is not meant to be used for other token deployments because it needs to be backwards compatible and thus contains a lot of legacy code that should not be used when deploying a new ledger.

If you want to deploy your own token, read the [guide on setting up an ICRC-1 ledger](/docs/defi/token-ledgers/setup/icrc1_ledger_setup).

## Using `dfx nns install`

The [`dfx nns install`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-nns) command can be used to deploy an instance of the entire NNS locally. The NNS includes the ICP ledger canister with canister ID `ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai`.

## Using the most recent ICP ledger Wasm file

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- #### Step 1: Create a new `dfx` project or open an existing project.

- #### Step 2: Obtain the latest ledger Wasm and Candid files.

Go to the [releases overview](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/releases) and copy the latest replica binary revision.

The URL for the ledger Wasm module is `https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/<REVISION>/canisters/ledger-canister.wasm.gz`.

The URL for the ledger's Candid file is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/<REVISION>/rs/ledger_suite/icp/ledger.did`.

#### Optional
If you want to make sure you have the latest ICP ledger files, you can run the following script. Please ensure that you have [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed, as the script relies on it.

``` sh
curl -o download_latest_icp_ledger.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9/rs/rosetta-api/scripts/download_latest_icp_ledger.sh"
chmod +x download_latest_icp_ledger.sh
./download_latest_icp_ledger.sh
```

- #### Step 3: Create a new identity that will work as a minting account.

``` sh
dfx identity new minter
dfx identity use minter
echo $(dfx ledger account-id)
```

Record the output of these commands as your minting account ID. Transfers from the minting account will create `Mint` transactions. Transfers to the minting account will create `Burn` transactions.

- #### Step 4: Switch back to your primary developer identity and record its ledger account identifier.

``` sh
dfx identity use MyIdentity
echo $(dfx ledger account-id)
```

Record the output of these commands as your developer account ID.

- #### Step 5: Configure the `dfx.json` file.

Open the `dfx.json` file in your project's directory. Replace the existing content with the following, updating the values of `MINTER_ACCOUNT_ID` and `DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT_ID` with the values obtained in the previous steps:

`dfx.json` does not support referring to values through environment variables. Values must be hardcoded in plain text.

``` json
{
  "canisters": {
    "icp_ledger_canister": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9/rs/ledger_suite/icp/ledger.did",
      "wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9/canisters/ledger-canister.wasm.gz",
      "remote": {
        "id": {
          "ic": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
        }
      },
      "init_arg" : "(variant { Init = record { minting_account = \"MINTER_ACCOUNT_ID\"; initial_values = vec { record { \"DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID\"; record { e8s = 10_000_000_000 : nat64; }; }; }; send_whitelist = vec {}; transfer_fee = opt record { e8s = 10_000 : nat64; }; token_symbol = opt \"LICP\"; token_name = opt \"Local ICP\"; } })"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "args": "",
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env",
  "version": 1
}
```

:::danger
If you chose to download the ICP ledger files with the script, you need to replace the Candid and Wasm file entries:

```json
...
"candid": icp_ledger.did,
"wasm" : icp_ledger.wasm.gz,
  ...
```

:::

This `dfx.json` file defines the init arguments for the ledger canister:

- Sets the minting account to the account identifier you saved in a previous step (`MINTER_ACCOUNT_ID`).
- Mints 100 ICP tokens to the `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID` (1 ICP is equal to 10^8 e8s).
- Sets the transfer fee to 0.0001 ICP.
- Names the token `Local ICP / LICP`.

### Init arguments

You can also pass these init args to the canister [using the command line](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/advanced-dfx/init-args/#using-init_arg) or by [storing them in a file](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/advanced-dfx/init-args/#using-an-init_arg_file), then referencing that file in your `dfx.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "icp_ledger_canister": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9/rs/ledger_suite/icp/ledger.did",
      "wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9/canisters/ledger-canister.wasm.gz",
      "remote": {
        "id": {
          "ic": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
        }
      },
      "init_arg_file" : "init-args.did"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "args": "",
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env",
  "version": 1
}
```

[Learn more about init args](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/advanced-dfx/init-args/).

- #### Step 6: Start a local development environment.

``` sh
dfx start --clean --background
```

- #### Step 7: Deploy the ledger canister locally.

You cannot deploy this canister to the playground (using the flag `dfx deploy --playground`) because it does not accept gzipped Wasm files.

```
dfx deploy --specified-id ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai icp_ledger_canister
```

You are deploying the local ICP ledger canister to the same canister ID as the mainnet ledger canister. This is to facilitate switching between local and mainnet deployments.

Your local ICP ledger canister is up and running. You can now deploy other canisters that need to communicate with the ledger canister.

- #### Step 8: Interact with the canister.

You can interact with the canister by running CLI commands, such as:

```
dfx canister call icp_ledger_canister name
```

Or, you can interact with it using the Candid UI by navigating to the URL provided when the canister was deployed, such as:

```
http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai&id=ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
```
