# Using an ICRC-1 ledger

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate" , "Ledgers"]} />

There are three primary methods used to interact with an ICRC-1 ledger:

- `dfx canister`: The generic canister call from `dfx` used to call a canister's methods.

- `ic-cdk`: Inter-canister calls for the ICRC-1 ledger.

- [`ledger-icrc-js`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/ledger-icrc): A library for interfacing with an ICRC-1 ledger on the Internet Computer.

## Interact with an ICRC-1 canister using `dfx canister call`

### ICRC-1

Use the following command syntax to interact with an ICRC-1 ledger via `dfx canister`:

```
dfx canister call <canister-id> <method-name> <arguments>
```

For example, to fetch the token symbol of an ICRC-1 ledger, call the `icrc1_symbol` method:

```
dfx canister call ss2fx-dyaaa-aaaar-qacoq-cai icrc1_symbol '()'
```

Whether your ICRC-1 ledger will have all available methods enabled will depend on if you choose to support any of the extensions of ICRC-1 (ICRC-2, ICRC-3,...).

You can always check which standards are supported by a certain ICRC-1 ledger by calling:

```
dfx canister call <canister-id> icrc1_supported_standards '()'
```

You can find all available methods for your ICRC-1 ledger within the ICRC-1 ledger canister's Candid file or, if your ICRC-1 ledger has been deployed to the mainnet, view your ICRC-1 ledger canister [on the dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canisters). An example of an ICRC-1 ledger deployed on the mainnet that you can reference is the [ckETH ledger canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ss2fx-dyaaa-aaaar-qacoq-cai).

View the [`dfx canister call` documentation](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-call) for more information on calling canister methods.


### ICRC-2

For ledgers that support ICRC-2, you can call ICRC-2 methods. ICRC-2 methods include those for `approve` workflows. For specifics, see the [ICRC-2 standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-2#icrc2_approve).

View the [`dfx canister call` documentation](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-call) for more information on calling canister methods.

## Interacting with an ICRC-1 ledger from your web application (`ledger-icrc-js`)

[View references and examples on how to use the `ledger-icrc-js` library to interact with ICRC-1 ledgers](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/ledger-icrc).

## Interacting with an ICRC-1 ledger from another canister (inter-canister calls via `ic-cdk`)

When calling into arbitrary ICRC-1 ledgers, we recommend you use [bounded wait (aka best-effort response) calls](/docs/references/async-code). These calls ensure that your canister does not get stuck waiting for a response from the ledger.

Here sample code to fetch the transfer fee from an ICRC-1 ledger using Rust and the `ic-cdk` [library](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs) from within a canister. The example includes retry logic to handle errors when possible.

```rust
pub enum GetFeeError {
    /// The ledger didn't implement the ICRC-1 API correctly, e.g., returning an invalid response.
    Icrc1ApiViolation(String),
    /// A CDK CallError that we cannot recover from synchronously.
    FatalCallError(CallFailed),
}

/// Obtain the fee that the ledger canister charges for a transfer.
/// This functiuon will keep retrying to fetch the fees for as long possible, and for as long as the
/// `should_retry` predicate returns true. Note that using a predicate that just always returns
/// `true` can keep your canister in a retry loop, and potentially unable to upgrade. The
/// recommended way is to set a limit on the number of retries, use a timeout, or abort when the
/// caller canister enters the stopping state.
pub async fn icrc1_get_fee<P>(ledger: Principal, should_retry: &P) -> Result<NumTokens, GetFeeError>
where
    P: Fn() -> bool,
{
    loop {
        match Call::bounded_wait(ledger, "icrc1_fee").await {
            Ok(res) => match res.candid() {
                Ok(fee) => return Ok(fee),
                Err(msg) => {
                    return Err(GetFeeError::Icrc1ApiViolation(format!(
                        "Unable to decode the fee: {:?}; failed with error {:?}",
                        res, msg
                    )))
                }
            },
            // The system rejected our call, but it is possible to retry immediately.
            // Since obtaining the fees is idempotent, it's always safe to retry.
            Err(err) if err.is_immediately_retryable() && should_retry() => continue,
            // The system rejected our call, but it is not possible to retry immediately.
            Err(err) => return Err(GetFeeError::FatalCallError(err)),
        }
    }
}
```

Here's sample code for transferring ICRC-1 ledger tokens using bounded wait response calls. It handles the unknown state case by using the [transaction deduplication feature](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/references/icrc1-standard#transaction-deduplication-) of ICRC-1 ledgers. However, if the transaction keeps failing beyond the deduplication window, the transaction state will be unknown and you will need to perform manual recovery.

```rust
pub enum TransferErrorCause {
    Icrc1ApiViolation(String),
    FatalCallError(CallFailed),
    LedgerError(TransferError),
}

pub enum Icrc1TransferError {
    // The transfer didn't happen.
    TransferFailed(TransferErrorCause),
    // The transfer may have happened.
    UnknownState(TransferErrorCause),
}

/// Transfer the tokens on the specified ledger. The caller must ensure that:
/// 1. The `created_at` time of the `TransferArg` is set.
/// 2. The transaction described by the `TransferArg` has not yet been executed by the ledger.
///    Otherwise, the function may return `Ok` even if the transfer didn't happen.
pub async fn icrc1_transfer<P>(
    ledger: Principal,
    arg: TransferArg,
    should_retry: &P,
) -> Result<BlockIndex, Icrc1TransferError>
where
    P: Fn() -> bool,
{
    assert!(
        arg.created_at_time.is_some(),
        "The created_at_time must be set in the TransferArg"
    );

    let mut no_unknowns = true;
    loop {
        match Call::bounded_wait(ledger, "icrc1_transfer")
            .with_arg(&arg)
            // Use the longest timeout supported by the system, as we'll retry later anyways.
            .change_timeout(u32::MAX)
            .await
        {
            Ok(res) => match res.candid() {
                Ok(Ok(i)) => return Ok(i),
                Ok(Err(e)) => match e {
                    // Since the assumption is that the transaction didn't happen before the call,
                    // treat a duplicate error as a success.
                    TransferError::Duplicate { duplicate_of } => return Ok(duplicate_of),
                    e if no_unknowns => {
                        return Err(Icrc1TransferError::TransferFailed(
                            TransferErrorCause::LedgerError(e),
                        ))
                    }
                    // Unknown state. To recover, you can query the ledger blocks to see if the
                    // transaction was executed.
                    e => {
                        return Err(Icrc1TransferError::UnknownState(
                            TransferErrorCause::LedgerError(e),
                        ))
                    }
                },
                Err(e) => {
                    return Err(Icrc1TransferError::TransferFailed(
                        TransferErrorCause::Icrc1ApiViolation(e.to_string()),
                    ))
                }
            },
            // Since the ICRC1 transfer is idempotent, it's always safe to retry.
            Err(e) if e.is_immediately_retryable() && should_retry() => {
                // If the reject wasn't clean, mark the state as unknown.
                if !e.is_clean_reject() {
                    no_unknowns = false;
                }
                continue;
            }
            Err(e) if e.is_clean_reject() && no_unknowns => {
                return Err(Icrc1TransferError::TransferFailed(
                    TransferErrorCause::FatalCallError(e),
                ))
            }
            Err(e) => {
                return Err(Icrc1TransferError::UnknownState(

                ))
            }
        }
    }

### `icrc-ledger-types` Rust crate

To interact with the ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 endpoints, the Rust crate [icrc-ledger-types](https://crates.io/crates/icrc-ledger-types) can be used.
This is true for the ICP ledger as well as any other canister that supports ICRC-1 or any of the ICRC-1 extension standards (i.e., ICRC-2, ICRC-3,...).

The crate can be installed with the command:

```
cargo add icrc-ledger-types
```

Or, it can be added to the `Cargo.toml` file:

```
icrc-ledger-types = "0.1.1"
```

[View the documentation for this crate](https://docs.rs/icrc-ledger-types/0.1.1/icrc_ledger_types/).
