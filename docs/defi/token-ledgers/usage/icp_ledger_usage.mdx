# Using the ICP ledger

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate" , "Ledgers"]} />

How you interact with the ICP ledger is dependent on whether you want to interact with it from the command line, from your web app, or from another canister. Available workflows and tools include:

- `dfx ledger`: The `dfx` CLI command for interacting with the ICP ledger.
- `dfx canister`: A generic canister call using `dfx`.
- [ledger-icp](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/ledger-icp) JavaScript library.
- `ic-cdk`: Inter-canister calls for the ICP ledger.

## Interacting with the ICP ledger via `dfx ledger`

`dfx` provides a convenience command to interact with the ICP ledger canister and related functionality: [`dfx ledger`](/docs/current/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-ledger).

`dfx` does not come with an ICP ledger instance installed by default. To be able to use this command, you will need to install the [ICP ledger locally](/docs/current/defi/token-ledgers/setup/icp_ledger_setup).

Currently, `dfx ledger` only exposes a subset of the ICP ledger functionality, namely `balance` and `transfer`.

View the [`dfx ledger`](/docs/current/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-ledger) documentation for all available `dfx ledger` commands and flags.

## Interacting with the ICP ledger via `dfx canister`

The ICP ledger canister ID is assumed to be `ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai`. If your locally deployed ICP ledger's canister ID is different, you will need to replace `ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai` with it.

Use the following command syntax to interact with the ICP ledger via `dfx canister`:

```
dfx canister call <canister-id> <method-name> <arguments>
```

For example, to fetch the token symbol of the ICP ledger, call the `symbol` method:

```
dfx canister call ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai symbol '()'
```

You can find all available methods listed within the ICP ledger canister's Candid file or view the [mainnet ICP ledger canister on the dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai).

[View a more detailed description of the data types used in these commands](/docs/current/specifications/ledger#_getting_ledger_blocks).

## Interact with ICP ledger from your web application

In order to simplify working with the ICP ledger from JavaScript applications, you can use the [ledger-icp](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/ledger-icp) JavaScript library.

To interact with the ICRC-1 endpoints of the ICP ledger, learn more about [interacting with an ICRC-1 ledger](/docs/current/defi/token-indexes/).

## Interacting with ICP from a canister (inter-canister calls via `ic-cdk`)

View the [inter-canister call documentation] (/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/cdks/rust/intercanister) to see how you can call one canister from within another.

Here is an example of how to fetch the token name from the ICP ledger using Rust and the `ic-cdk` [library](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs) from within a canister:

```
// You will need the canister ID of the ICP ledger: `ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai`.

let ledger_id = Principal::from_text("ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai").unwrap();

// The request object of the `icrc1_name` endpoint is empty.

    let req = ();
    let (res,): (String,) =
        ic_cdk::call(ledger_id, "icrc1_name", (req,))
            .await.unwrap();
```

You can find all available methods listed within the ICP ledger canister's Candid file or view the [mainnet ICP ledger canister on the dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai).

### `icrc-ledger-types` Rust crate

As explained in [token standards](/docs/current/defi/token-standards/), the ICP ledger supports all ICRC-1 endpoints. You will need to define the structures used for these endpoints.

To interact with the ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 endpoints, the Rust crate [icrc-ledger-types](https://crates.io/crates/icrc-ledger-types) can be used.
This is true for the ICP ledger as well as any other canister that supports ICRC-1 or any of the ICRC-1 extension standards (i.e., ICRC-2, ICRC-3,...).

The crate can be installed with the command:

```
cargo add icrc-ledger-types
```

Or, it can be added to the `Cargo.toml` file:

```
icrc-ledger-types = "0.1.1"
```

[View the documentation for this crate](https://docs.rs/icrc-ledger-types/0.1.1/icrc_ledger_types/).

### Receiving ICP

If you want a canister to receive payment in ICP, you need to make sure that the canister knows about the payment because a transfer only involves the sender and the ledger canister.

There are currently two main patterns to achieve this. Furthermore, there is a [chartered working group](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcing-technical-working-groups/11781) on ledger and tokenization that is focused on defining a standard ledger token interface and payment flows.

#### Direct notification by sender

In this pattern, the sender notifies the receiver about the payment. However, the receiver needs to verify the payment by using the [`query_blocks` interface](/docs/current/specifications/ledger#_getting_ledger_blocks) of the ledger.

The following diagram shows a simplified illustration of this pattern:

```plantuml
    participant Sender
    participant "ICP Ledger"
    participant Receiver

    Sender -> "ICP Ledger": transfer()
    "ICP Ledger" --> Sender: blockNumber
    Sender -> Receiver: notify(blockNumber)
    Receiver -> "ICP Ledger": query_blocks(blockNumber)
    "ICP Ledger" --> Receiver: block
    Receiver -> Receiver: verify payment
```

#### Notification by ICP ledger (currently disabled)

In this pattern, the ledger itself notifies the receiver. Thereby, the receiver can trust the notification immediately. However, this flow is currently disabled because the call to the receiver is not yet implemented as a one-way call.

```plantuml
    participant Sender
    participant "ICP Ledger"
    participant Receiver

    Sender -> "ICP Ledger": transfer()
    "ICP Ledger" --> Sender: blockNumber
    Sender -> "ICP Ledger": notify(blockNumber, receiver)
    "ICP Ledger" -> "Receiver": transaction_notification(details)
```
