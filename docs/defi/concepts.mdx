## Accounts: Principals and subaccounts

ICP token accounts use principals and their associated subaccount to generate an `AccountIdentifier` value to identify the account owner.

ICRC-1 token accounts use an `Account` value that corresponds to the pair `(principal, subaccount)`, where a principal can have multiple accounts, and each subaccount of a principal is identified by a 32-byte string.

### Principals

Every token account is owned by a single principal. Principals are unique identifiers used to identify both users and canisters on ICP.

### Subaccounts

Each principal can have multiple accounts identified by a `32-byte` string called a **subaccount**. Subaccounts are used for organizing funds within a single principal for optimized management and transparency. Subaccounts can be used to distinguish between personal funds and business funds, or separate funds for one project from another.

## ICP tokens

The ICP token is the network's native token used for various utility and governance functions, such as:

- Converting tokens into cycles.

- Rewarding node providers for contributing resources to the network.

- Rewarding neurons for staking ICP into a neuron and voting on governance proposals.
