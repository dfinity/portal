# ICRC-2

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tokens"]} />

The ICRC-2 standard is an extension of the ICRC-1 standard that enables additional functionality for `icrc2_approve` and `icrc2_transfer_from` transactions. Since it is an extension of ICRC-1, it supports all of the ICRC-1 standard's methods and metadata. The `approve` method allows an account owner to delegate token transfers to a third party on the owner's behalf, while the `transfer_from` method enables approved token transactions to be initiated. These workflows are common in the Ethereum ecosystem through the ERC-20 token standard.

The `approve` and `transfer_from` workflow uses two steps:

1. First, the account owner allows another user to transfer up to X tokens from their account (A) by calling the ledger's `icrc2_approve` method.

2. The user transfers up to X tokens from account A to any account through the `icrc2_transfer_from` method. The number of transfers is not limited as long as the total amount spent is below X.
