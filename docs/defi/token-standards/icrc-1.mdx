# ICRC-1

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tokens"]} />

The ICRC-1 standard is for fungible tokens on ICP. It is considered the 'base' standard and intentionally **excludes** certain features and functions, such as:

- Reliable transaction notifications for smart contracts.

- A block structure and the interface for fetching blocks.

- Pre-signed transactions.

ICRC-1 supports extensions of this standard to implement these missing functions, and the `icrc1_supported_standards` endpoint can be queried to return the name of all supported extensions.

### Token metadata

Token metadata is used to provide information about the token, such as the name, symbol, or fee. Available metadata entries for ICRC-1 tokens include:

- `icrc1:symbol`: The token's currency code, such as `variant { Text = "XTKN" }`.

- `icrc1:name`: The token's name, such as `variant { Text = "Test Token" }`.

- `icrc1:decimals`: The number of decimals used by the token, such as `variant { Nat = 8 }`.

- `icrc1:fee`: The token's default transfer fee, such as `variant { Nat = 10_000 }`.
