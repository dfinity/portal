# Tokenomics and Governance

Starting to work with decentralized applications involves opening our minds to new ways of interacting, and controlling, the systems that we build upon. This category guides you through some of the processes and mental shifts that help to make the most of dapps and the Internet Computer. 

## Identity & Authentication

One of the advantages of building apps on the Internet Computer is that users can interact and authenticate without the need for holding tokens. This is facilitated by Internet Identity.

<!-- There are many ways to interact with the IC; as a user, as a developer, as a token holder and communicating with these different entities required different forms of identification. -->

## Token Holders
There are multiple ways to obtain token; purchasing via an exchange, earning as a node provider, receiving from a friend, or otherwise. Learn about some options for how to hold tokens, and how you can set up self-custody. Follow the quickstart to take control of your tokens.

## Governance
As we move to more and more decentralization, it is crucial to learn more about the IC components that facilitate community governance.
