# DAOs and Tokenomics

When building our documentation we tried to include the natural guides for developers; how to [get started](/tutorials/index.mdx) with canister smart contract development, how to [make progress]/developer-docs/build/index.md), how to [deploy]/developer-docs/production/index.md), update and manage apps. There were some remarks about cycles and their use in computation and about [integrating various features]/developer-docs/integrations/index.md) of the IC. Yet, somehow it still felt like something was lacking in the documentation. Building on the IC is about more than just the code. 

Decentralized applications inherently require us to open our minds to new ways of thinking and coding, but also of interacting, controlling, funding and planning. This category of documentation aims to capture the more *entrepreneurial* considerations that will likely arise in a move towards a more open internet. This is done both via noting considerations that should be made by developers, builders and founders, but also by users of dapps, as, after all, in the read-write-own model of web 3, users play a key role in the development of dapps. 

Welcome to our DAO docs. If there's anything in particular you'd like to see here, it's open, feel free to contribute.

## Network Nervous System (NNS)
The NNS is the open tokenized DAO that controls the IC. As we move to more and more decentralization, it is crucial to learn more about the IC components that facilitate community governance. The NNS allows users to participate the governance of the IC by staking tokens and voting (or delegating votes - liquid democracy ftw) and to earn rewards over time. 
- A more detailed introduction to the NNS can be [found here](./nns/nns-intro.md)
- Proposals, voting and rewards are [explained here](./nns/nns-staking-voting-rewards.md) can be explored in the [Governance section](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance) on the dashboard
- You can read about the community fund [here](./nns/community-fund.md)
- Start participating in the NNS app by checking out the [NNS Intro](token-holders/nns-app-quickstart.md)

## Service Nervous System (SNS)
As the NNS is to the IC, an SNS is to services running on the IC. If you are a developer or founder who would like to tokenize and decentralize the governance of your dapp, this is the place to start. Governance of a service or dapp can operate in a decentralized manner by getting an SNS. 
- [Dive into the SNS and DAOs](/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics/sns-intro-tokens.md)
- See the [tokenomics of a DAO](/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics/tokenomics.md)
- Think about the numerous [considerations](/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics//predeployment-considerations.md) that should be made if you plan to get an SNS


## Identity & Authentication
One of the advantages of building apps on the Internet Computer is that users can interact and authenticate without the need for holding tokens. This is facilitated by Internet Identity.

## Token Holders
There are multiple ways to obtain token; purchasing via an exchange, earning as a node provider, receiving from a friend, or otherwise. Learn about some options for how to hold tokens, and how you can set up self-custody. Follow the quickstart to take control of your tokens.
