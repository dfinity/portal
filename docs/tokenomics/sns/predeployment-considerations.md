# SNS Predeployment Considerations

## Background
The service network systems (SNS) provide application developers a turnkey option for decentralizing their dapp through a token sale. The decision to launch a token via the SNS has many implications for the business behind the dapp and developers should deeply consider these business implications throughout the process of tokenizing their dapp.

## Prior to Launching an SNS Token

The groundwork for a successful token launch is laid *well before* the proposal for an SNS is submitted to the NNS. A developer may want to consider doing the following in the interest of making their dapp attractive to future investors:
* Demonstrating the dapp’s **product-market fit** through growth and usage metrics. A founder should be able to demonstrate that the dapp has active users loyal to the dapp
* Explaining clearly the **future utility** of the soon-to-be-launched token within the dapp ecosystem. Example utility could be:
    * The ability to use the token to pay for in-application purchases of goods or services
    * Access to additional functionality or services within the dapp
    * Interoperability with other dapps
* Demonstrating **positive unit economics** (ability to generate value per new user greater than cost of acquiring new user) and/or user scalability for continued growth of the dapp
* Articulating business **risks and mitigation plans**
* Acquiring any regulatory approvals, or having a plan to do so
* Achieving growth or other hurdles for competition that make it challenging for competitors to replicate the dapp's success

:::note
In addition to the above, tokenizing the dapp on the SNS will decentralize control of the dapp and place the dapp under the control of a DAO/many different parties. This usually means that development of the dapp will *slow down* due to the need to get many people or parties in agreement for changes, instead of just the developers. Therefore, the developers of the dapp must feel comfortable that the code base is in a stable place and the product roadmap is positioned for the likely slowdown in development speed.

## Starting an SNS Sale Though NNS Proposal
The launch process for an SNS token sale includes a step of sending a proposal for approval to the NNS. The NNS proposal to add a dapp to the SNS serves many functions, including as an opportunity to pitch the dapp to the NNS community and potential SNS investors.  An NNS proposal should build trust within the NNS community that the dapp is sustainable in the long run and that the dapp is investor-ready. Therefore, a proposal should include standard information that would be presented at a venture capitalist slide deck, including:
* The management **team backgrounds** and any previous **successful application launches**
* The [total addressable market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market) of the dapp market space
* **Proof of product-market fit** and growth traction, including the source of the information
* The utility of the token and **the tokenomics** and why this encourages price stability and growth
* A **product roadmap** showing clear understanding of the user's needs and a prioritization of the tasks to be carried out
* A **communication plan** to ensure continued growth of user-base 
* **Business competition**, both at the time of the proposal and expected future competition
* Budget and financial details, including what the raised funds will be used for, if appropriate
* A description of the technology stack for the dapp.
* If applicable, information on the desired token holding audience to ensure long-term success and continued pursuit of the initial intent and vision of the dapp roadmap.

## After the Launch
After launching a token, it’s important for developers to manage their new investor stakeholders.  Even though the dapp is decentralized following the initial token sale, it’s possible that the original developers will need to continue to lead the project as the project matures into its decentralization.  During this stage, it’s possible that developers may need to work closely with the token holding community to continue project success and direction. This may include providing data and information about ecosystem growth and financial changes.  It also may include managing the product roadmap with token-holder input, feedback and buy-in.
