# Security best practices: Decentralization

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Security", "Best practices"]} />

## Use a decentralized governance system like SNS to put dapps under decentralized control

### Security concerns

If single entities or small groups control canisters, they can apply changes or updates whenever they like. If a canister, e.g., holds assets such as ICP, ckBTC, or ckETH on a user's behalf, this effectively means that the controller could decide at any time to steal these funds through methods such as updating the canister and transferring the assets to their account.

Furthermore, the controller of canisters serving web content (such as e.g., the [asset canister](/docs/references/asset-canister)) could maliciously modify the web application to e.g., steal user funds or perform security-sensitive actions on the user's behalf. For example, if [Internet Identity](/docs/building-apps/authentication/overview) is used, the user principal's private key for the given origin is stored in the browser storage, and a malicious app can therefore fully control the private key, the user's session, and any assets controlled by that key.

Dapps are commonly reachable over their own custom domain name instead of ic0.app. These domains are registered with a DNS registrar by one of the developers. The developer can choose to have this domain point at a completely different web application, even one not hosted on ICP. Users will trust this domain and the app it serves. This could allow such a developer to steal funds, leak data, etc.

A dapp might have privileged features that are only accessible to principals that are on an allow list. For example, minting new tokens, debugging functions, managing permissions, removing NFTs for digital rights violations, etc. This means that whoever controls that principal (such as the dapp developers) may have central control over these privileged features.

For performance or privacy reasons, some components of a dapp may be hosted off-chain. These off-chain components often control principals used to interact with the onchain components and are usually controlled by a developer holding credentials to the off-chain cloud environment. On top of that, off-chain entities such as providers can inspect and manipulate data in this environment if they choose. They could take ICP principal private keys out of this environment and call privileged operations on the canisters. Off-chain components can quickly lead to many additional centrally trusted parties. Depending on the value managed by a dapp, these parties could be tempted to act maliciously.

### Recommendations

In the following list, we first provide recommendations for centralized dapp control and then move to recommendations for increasingly decentralized settings. From a security perspective, more decentralization is favorable. The following list could also be used as a basis for assessing a dapp's level of decentralization. This is just a set of recommendations and may not be complete.
1. **The dapp uses central, off-chain components:** The application makes use of centralized components such as those running in the cloud. The owners of these cloud services have full control over the application and assets managed by it. Your application should likely be further decentralized by avoiding central components. But while you have them, [securely manage your keys in the cloud](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/topics/cloud-key-management/).
2. **The dapp is controlled by the developer team:** Your project is not under decentralized control, for example, because it is in an early development stage or does not (yet) hold significant funds. In that case, it is recommended to manage access to your canisters securely and ideally not let individuals control the application. To achieve that, consider the following:
    - Require approval by several individuals or parties to perform any canister controller operations.
    - Require approval by several individuals or parties for any security-sensitive changes at the application level that are restricted to privileged principals, such as admin operations including permissions management, minting new tokens, removing NFTs for digital rights violations, etc.
    - A helpful tool to achieve either of the above two points is the [threshold canister](https://github.com/dfinity/threshold). Individuals should manage their key material using hardware security modules, such as [YubyHSM](https://www.yubico.com/ch/store/yubihsm-2-series/) and physically protect these through methods such as using safes at different geographical locations. Some of HSMs support threshold signature schemes, which can help to further secure the setup. To increase transparency about the changes made to a dapp, consider using a tool like [LaunchTrail](https://github.com/spinner-cash/launchtrail).
3. **Full decentralization using a DAO**: The dapp is controlled by a decentralized governance system such as ICP's [Service Nervous System (SNS)](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/overview), so that any security-sensitive changes to the canisters are only executed if the SNS community approves them collectively through a proposal voting mechanism. If an SNS is used:
    - Make sure voting power is distributed over many independent entities such that there is not one single or a few entities that can decide by themselves how the [DAO evolves](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/tokenomics/tokenomics-intro#voting-power-and-decentralization).
    - Ensure all components of the dapp are under SNS control, including the canisters serving the web frontends; see [SNS asset canisters](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/managing/sns-asset-canister).
    - Consider the [SNS preparation checklist](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/tokenomics/sns-checklist). Important points from a security perspective are [tokenomics](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/tokenomics/sns-checklist#11-tokenomics-specification), [disclosing dependencies to off-chain components](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/tokenomics/sns-checklist#13-disclosure-of-dependencies) and [performing security reviews](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/tokenomics/sns-checklist#21-security-review).
    - Rather than [self-deploying the SNS code](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/overview#self-deploy-the-sns-code) or [building your own DAO](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/overview#build-your-own-dao--use-other-dao-frameworks), consider using the official SNS on the SNS subnet, as this guarantees that the SNS is running an NNS-blessed version and maintained as part of ICP.
    - See also [verification and trust in a (launched) SNS](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Verification_and_trust_in_a_(launched)_SNS) and [SNS decentralization swap trust](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/SNS_decentralization_swap_trust).

An alternative to DAO control (3. above) would be to create an immutable canister smart contract by removing the canister controller completely. However, note that this implies that the canister cannot be upgraded, which may have severe implications in cases such as a bug was found. The option to use a decentralized governance system and thus be able to upgrade smart contracts is a big advantage of the ICP ecosystem compared to other blockchains.

Note that, contrary to some other blockchains, immutable smart contracts need cycles to run, and they can receive cycles.

It is also possible to implement a DAO [decentralized autonomous organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) on ICP from scratch. If you decide to do this (e.g., along the lines of the [basic DAO example](/docs/references/samples/rust/basic_dao/)), be aware that this is security critical and must be security reviewed carefully. Furthermore, users will need to verify that the DAO is controlled by itself.

## Verify the control and level of decentralization of smart contracts you depend on

### Security concern

If a dapp depends on a third-party canister smart contract (e.g., by making inter-canister calls to it), it is important to verify that the callee satisfies an appropriate level of decentralization. For example:
- If funds or cycles are transferred to a third-party canister, one might require the canister to be controlled by a decentralized governance system, as otherwise these funds are centrally controlled.
- If inter-canister calls are made to a centrally controlled and potentially malicious canister, that canister could execute a denial of service attack on the caller or even trigger functional bugs; see [be aware of the risks involved in calling untrustworthy canisters](/docs/building-apps/security/inter-canister-calls#be-aware-of-the-risks-involved-in-calling-untrustworthy-canisters).

### Recommendation

If you interact with a canister that you require to be decentralized, make sure it is controlled by the NNS, a service nervous system (SNS) or a decentralized governance system, and review under what conditions and by whom the smart contract can be changed.

## Donâ€™t load JavaScript or other assets from untrusted domains

### Security concern

Loading untrusted JavaScript from domains other than `<canister-id>.icp0.io` means you completely trust that domain. Also, assets loaded from these domains (incl. `<canister-id>.raw.icp0.io`) will not use asset certification.

If they deliver malicious JavaScript, they can take over the web app or account. This could, for example, happen by reading the private key managed by the [ICP JavaScript agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/agent) from the browser's local storage.

Note that also loading other assets such [as CSS](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/css-injection/) from untrusted domains is a security risk.

### Recommendation

- Loading JavaScript and other assets from other origins should be avoided. Especially for security-critical applications, you canâ€™t assume other domains to be trustworthy.

- Make sure all the content delivered to the browser is served and certified by the canister using asset certification. This holds in particular for any JavaScript, but also for fonts, CSS, etc.

- Use a [content security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) to prevent scripts and other content from other origins from being loaded at all. See also [define security headers, including a content security policy (CSP)](/docs/building-apps/security/resources#web-security).
