# Generating Candid files for Rust canisters

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Rust"]} />

Candid interface files (`.did`) are not generated automatically for Rust canisters like they are for Motoko canisters. For Rust canisters, you can: 
1. Write the `.did` file yourself
2. Use the [`candid-extractor`](https://crates.io/crates/candid-extractor) and [`generate-did`](https://crates.io/crates/generate-did) tools to extract the Candid from the canister's Wasm.


## Using [`candid-extractor`](https://crates.io/crates/candid-extractor) and [`generate-did`](https://crates.io/crates/generate-did) tools

### Step 1: Install `candid-extractor`

You need to install the `candid-extractor`, which is required for extracting the `.did` file in both approaches:

```bash
cargo install candid-extractor
``` 

### Step 2: Add the ``export_candid!`` macro 
In your Rust canister code, call the ``export_candid!`` macro at the end of your ``lib.rs`` file:

```rust
use ic_cdk::query;
use ic_cdk::update;

#[query]
fn hello(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}

#[update]
fn world(name: String) -> String {
    format!("World, {}!", name)
}

// Enable Candid export
ic_cdk::export_candid!();
``` 

### Step 3: Generate the .did file: 

You can now choose one of the following options:

#### Option 1: Automatic generation using ``generate-did`` crate.

[``generate-did``](https://crates.io/crates/generate-did) automates the build and extraction process into a single command.

Install it with:
```bash
cargo install generate-did
``` 

`candid-extractor` must be installed and in your `PATH` and the canister must be buildable to Wasm run from your project root.

Then, run:

```bash
generate-did <canister_name>
``` 

Replace `<canister_name>` with the directory name of your canister (which must include a valid ``Cargo.toml``).

This command will:
- Build the canister to Wasm.
- Extract the Candid interface.
- Place the `.did` file directly into the canister directory.

For more details, see:
- [generate-did crate](https://crates.io/crates/generate-did)
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Stephen-Kimoi/generate-did)

#### Option 2: Manual extraction using candid-extractor.

Before extracting the Candid interface, you must first compile the canister's Wasm module:

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --package <CANISTER>
```

The Wasm module will be stored at:

```bash
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<CANISTER>.wasm
```

Then you can extract the Candid interface from the Wasm module and save it to a file:

```bash
candid-extractor target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<CANISTER>.wasm > <CANISTER>.did
```
