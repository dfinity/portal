# Inter-canister calls

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Rust", "Tutorial"]} />

Just like users can call canisters, canisters can also call other canisters. This tutorial provides an introduction to using these inter-canister calls in Rust.

This example will demonstrate how to call an example counter canister, which provides four operations:
1. Getting the counter value.
2. Incrementing the counter.
3. Setting the counter to an arbitrary value.
4. Setting the counter to an arbitrary value while returning the previous value.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, clone the [Git examples repository](https://github.com/dfinity/examples). The code for this tutorial is in the `rust/inter-canister-calls` directory, where you can find the completed code in the `caller` package. Note that this example uses the alpha version of the Rust CDK.

Check out the Git repository of the tutorial. Then, in the tutorial directory, start a local development environment in the background and deploy the counter canister:

```bash
dfx start --background
dfx deploy counter
```

## Basic example: getting and setting the counter value

Your first example will be calling the `call_get_and_set` method on a second canister, the `caller` canister, which simply invokes the `get_and_set` method on the `counter` canister and forwards the result. This method sets the counter to the new value and returns the previous counter value.

The finished code for the project is already available in `src/caller`, or you can clear the contents of `src/caller/src/lib.rs` and paste the following code. The explanation is within the comments.

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/d0d3fc814d8ae646d6aba3878d01f08d42da0d4f/rust/inter-canister-calls/src/caller/src/lib.rs#L1-L40
```

Now, deploy the `caller` canister to the local development environment. This will give you some warnings about unused imports, but these will be used these later in the tutorial.

```bash
dfx deploy caller
```

Let's test it out. Make a call to the `caller` canister:

```bash
dfx canister call caller call_get_and_set
```

Now, `dfx` will use the `dfx.json` file provided in this tutorial's repository to search what parameters the different endpoints of the `caller` canister require. The `dfx.json` points to the `src/caller/caller.did` file, which describes the parameters of `call_get_and_set`. With this, `dfx` will first prompt you to provide a principal for the `counter` parameter of the `call_get_and_set` method.

You can type `counter` and press `TAB` on your keyboard to pass the principal of the `counter` canister as the parameter, and then `Enter` to confirm. Also, select a number to set the counter to, say `42`.  Then, you will see an output such as:

```bash
(0 : nat, 42 : nat)
```

Here, the counter was increased from `0` to `42`.

As the example notes, panicking when handling call errors is generally a bad idea past trivial examples such as this one. This is due to the nature of ICP's messaging model.

## IC calls are asynchronous: non-atomic set-then-get

You have already seen that the inter-canister calls use the Rust `async/await` syntax, hinting at the fact that these calls are **asynchronous**. This is a profound difference to the messaging model of some other chains (e.g., Ethereum). It enables significantly higher throughput, but can also affect correctness.

To illustrate, let's look at the following example, where it first calls the `set` method on the `counter` canister, and then calls `get` afterwards. Add the following code to your `src/caller/src/lib.rs`.

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/d0d3fc814d8ae646d6aba3878d01f08d42da0d4f/rust/inter-canister-calls/src/caller/src/lib.rs#L42-L60
```

Let's try this out. As shown below, you can also pass the arguments directly to `dfx` instead of using the menu by encoding [Candid values](/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/candid/candid-concepts) manually.

```bash
dfx canister call caller set_then_get "( principal \"`dfx canister id counter`\", 7 : nat )"
```

You should get the expected result:

```bash
(7 : nat)
```

The value that is read from the counter is exactly the same as the value that was set. But as noted in the comments, this doesn't always have to hold! As ICP calls are executed asynchronously, in between when the `set` and `get` calls in `call_get_and_set` execute, another canister could also call the `counter` canister and change the counter value. This of course cannot happen on your local installation since you control exactly which calls are made, but it can happen as soon as you install the code on the ICP mainnet.

This behavior enables much higher concurrent throughput between different canisters, since the `counter` canister isn't blocked from processing other requests while the `caller` canister is doing its processing. However, it also has correctness and security implications. One particularly important aspect is that state changes aren't atomic. If you make multiple calls, the failure of a later call doesn't roll back the effects of previous calls.

This also holds true for the effects on the `caller` canister itself. In particular, a caller that panics after making a call can end up in an inconsistent state. This is not an issue for the examples demonstrated so far, as the caller's internal state doesn't exist and thus can't become inconsistent.

For more information on the asynchronous execution model and its implications, read the documentation on [inter-canister calls and async code](/docs/references/async-code), [properties of call execution](/docs/references/message-execution-properties) and [security best practices](/docs/building-apps/security/security-best-practices/inter-canister-calls).

:::info
To summarize, the Internet Computer has an asynchronous messaging model that is different from Ethereum and many other blockchains. While it improves [scalability](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34576974172692-Evolution-Scaling), you need to understand the implications, especially around when and how state is persisted.

## Unbounded-wait calls: semantics and error cases

The examples so far we have relied on *unbounded-wait calls*, without elaborating on what these are. An unbounded wait call instructs the system to wait for however long it takes in order to receive a response. This allows the system to always provide the caller with the exact response to the call. Since the response is thus guaranteed to be delivered to the caller, these calls are also referred to as *guaranteed response* calls.

Note that this response can still be a failure. For example, a call might fail because the called canister does not exist (e.g., it has been deleted), but also because the system is overloaded and can't deliver the call to the callee, so it just returns an error to the caller. It can also fail if the callee fails, for example, if it panics. In the absence of callee failure, an error result from an unbounded-wait call ensures that the call did not execute, that is, that it's cleanly rejected.

Extend the example by adding this code to `src/caller/src/lib`:

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/d0d3fc814d8ae646d6aba3878d01f08d42da0d4f/rust/inter-canister-calls/src/caller/src/lib.rs#L62-L80
```

A clean reject of the increment call means that the counter hasn't changed. In general, if a call that changes the callee's state (such as `increment`) is rejected, this means that the state hasn't changed. With a non-clean reject you may not know what happened on the callee side and a thorough analysis may be needed.

The only cause of non-clean rejects for unbounded calls are panics and rejects on the callee side. These may be intentional rejects, or intentional panics on error conditions (such as the examples with the `expect` functions used earlier). They may also be bugs in the callee or the Wasm runtime may trap (the Wasm equivalent of panics) because the callee ran out of resources, such as available memory or cycles to perform some operations. In default local configurations, you don't have to worry about such resources.

Redeploy the canister to compile the added code, then observe the effect of `call_increment`:

```bash
dfx deploy caller
dfx canister call counter get
(7: nat)
dfx canister call caller call_increment "( principal \"`dfx canister id counter`\" )"
()
dfx canister call counter get
(8: nat)
```

However, on the mainnet, without further precautions even incrementing our simple counter canister may trap because it fails to allocate memory for processing the request. To cope, the [best practice](/docs/building-apps/best-practices/idempotency) is to modify the callee to provide an endpoint that allows callers to query the result of state-changing calls. Furthermore, where possible, it is also good practice to make endpoints *idempotent*, where executing a call twice (and thus also multiple times) has the same effect as executing it just once, allowing the caller to simply retry its call. Such practices are also helpful for ingress calls, i.e., for outside users and applications interacting with your application over HTTP.

Unbounded-wait calls thus can provide a simple error handling semantics, as long as you are very confident that the callee won't trap, or you for some reason don't care about the cases of the callee trapping. However, the fact that these calls will wait for as long as it takes to receive a response means that they don't return for as long as the callee is delaying providing an answer. In the case of buggy (or even malicious) callees, the caller may end up waiting forever. This can block the caller from upgrading cleanly, since a clean upgrade requires all of the caller's outstanding calls to complete. As an alternative, you can use *bounded-wait* calls, as demonstrated next.

:::info
To summarize, unbounded wait calls wait for a response forever, but the response might still be a failure. With unbounded wait calls, failures mean that either the call wasn't executed, or that the callee trapped or rejected the call. Waiting forever carries risks when calling untrusted canisters.
:::

## Bounded-wait calls: semantics and error cases

*Bounded-wait calls* do not wait forever for the response to arrive, but will effectively time out after a while and just return an error to the caller. For this reason, they are also referred to as *best-effort response* calls. These calls have two significant advantages over unbounded-wait calls:

1. They ensure that your canister won't stall (in particular, become unable to stop and upgrade) if it calls into canisters you don't control or trust.
2. They scale much better.

However, they have more complicated error handling: non-clean rejects, where you don't know whether the call was executed, can result not only from panics on the caller, but also from timing the call out. This increases the chance of non-clean rejects significantly. Callee panics should be an edge case, but timeouts will also occur whenever the load on the system or the callee is high.

Thus, bounded-wait calls are suitable only for reads, or for state-changing calls that follow the best practice of providing a separate query endpoint for the result, and/or are idempotent.

For example, you can safely call the `counter` canister's `get` endpoint using a bounded-wait call, since this is just a read. Edit `src/caller/src/lib.rs` to add the following method:

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/d0d3fc814d8ae646d6aba3878d01f08d42da0d4f/rust/inter-canister-calls/src/caller/src/lib.rs#L82-L99
```

Let's try it out. Redeploy the canister and call the new method:

```bash
dfx deploy caller
dfx canister call caller call_get "( principal \"`dfx canister id counter`\" )"
(variant { Ok = 8 : nat })
```

Idempotent endpoints give the caller a chance to try and clean errors up by simply retrying. For example, the `set` endpoint of the counter is idempotent. But even with idempotent endpoints, there are limits to what the caller can do. For example, it shouldn't retry forever, because, as mentioned earlier, this might block the canister from upgrading.

Furthermore, there are also errors that are likely to be hit again if you just retry immediately. In this case, you will have to leave the clean up to the upstream caller. Let's see an example of what a retry strategy might look like.

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/d0d3fc814d8ae646d6aba3878d01f08d42da0d4f/rust/inter-canister-calls/src/caller/src/lib.rs#L101-L137
```

To test, let's call the new endpoint with the value 42.

```bash
dfx canister call caller stubborn_set "( principal \"`dfx canister id counter`\", 42 : nat )"
(variant { Ok })
```

The Rust CDK provides helpful functions such as `is_clean_reject` and `is_immediately_retryable` to help with error handling. Under the hood, this interprets the different reject codes generated by the system. If you have more knowledge of how your canister works, you may be able to provide a more precise interpretation for your use case. Consult the [interface specification](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec/) and its section on [reject codes](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec/#reject-codes) for more details.

:::info
To summarize, bounded-wait calls will time out after a while, but you might not know whether the callee executed the call or not. Use them for reads or endpoints that are idempotent or provide a way to query their results.

## Attaching cycles: canister signatures

A canister can attach [cycles](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/tokens-and-cycles) (Internet Computer "gas") to any call that they make, transferring cycles from the caller's to the callee's cycle balance. The callee must explicitly [accept](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/call/fn.msg_cycles_accept128.html) such cycles; non-accepted cycles are refunded to the caller.

Cycle transfers are generally either used to pay for the callee's costs of processing the call or to move and store cycles as assets. An example where they are used to pay for call processing costs is the IC [threshold signature feature](/docs/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-ecdsa), which allows a canister to hold a cryptographic key and sign messages with it. An example of cycles being used as assets is the [cycles ledger](/docs/defi/token-ledgers/cycles-ledger/).

Below is a threshold signature example that shows how to attach cycles to a call:

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/d0d3fc814d8ae646d6aba3878d01f08d42da0d4f/rust/inter-canister-calls/src/caller/src/lib.rs#L139-L181
```

Let's test this by calling the `sign_message` method. The exact signature in your response will differ, as it will based on a secret key from your local development environment.

```bash
dfx canister call caller sign_message '("Some text to be signed")'
(
  variant {
    Ok = "394b7250ab7a088238fae3af9b60fec521584ac8c874b2ca72e6b950cda509452f307006693c342636afb5b2cb7a395106cc04365bd499c0064f5842a0bdbe2f"
  },
)
```

Cycles can be attached to both bounded and unbounded wait messages. For unbounded wait messages, cycles that are not consumed by the callee are guaranteed to be refunded to the caller. As the example notes, refunds do not happen for bounded-wait calls that result in an error with the `SysUnknown` reject code, which is the code issued when the system decides to stop waiting for a response.

However, this is usually acceptable for API calls that charge for cycles, since the amount charged is usually low (10 billion cycles for signatures with the test key). For transferring larger amounts of cycles, switch to using unbounded wait calls. See the section on [inter-canister calls](/docs/references/async-code) for more details.

:::info
To summarize, you can transfer cycles to the callee by attaching them to a bounded- or unbounded-wait call. Bounded-wait calls may drop the attached cycles, so avoid using them for large cycle amounts.

## Further reading

More details on how inter-canister calls execute and how the different call types work is provided in the documentation on [inter-canister calls and async code](/docs/references/async-code). Also consult the documentation on [properties of call execution](/docs/references/message-execution-properties) and [security best practices](/docs/building-apps/security/security-best-practices/inter-canister-calls). To allow your callers to handle call errors robustly, follow the [best practice](/docs/building-apps/best-practices/idempotency) document on retries and idempotency.

As noted in the above examples, an `update` method can always call any method of any other canister. In cases where you only need to call query methods on other canisters, and if you are sure that these canisters are on the same [subnet](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34209955782420-Subnet-Creation) as your canister, you can also use [composite query calls](/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/query-calls) methods instead of update methods.
