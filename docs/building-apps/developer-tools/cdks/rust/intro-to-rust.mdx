# Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a fast, reliable, and safe programming language with a large, active developer community. To build ICP applications in Rust, you can use the [Rust canister development kit (CDK)](https://crates.io/crates/ic-cdk). A CDK interfaces with the [IC SDK](/building-apps/getting-started/install) to provide a programming language with functionalities for creating, deploying, calling, and managing canisters.

The Rust CDK and other Rust crates provide support for the full suite of ICP features, including [HTTP certification](/building-apps/network-features/using-http/http-certification/custom-http-canisters), [composite queries](/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/query-calls), and [query stats](/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/query-calls), while other CDKs may have limited support for some advanced features.

Most developers use the IC SDK to build Rust canisters; however, experienced developers can opt to bypass the SDK and work directly with the Rust CDK for more fine-grained control.

The Rust CDK includes the following crates:

- [`ic-cdk`](https://crates.io/crates/ic-cdk): Core methods that enable Rust programs to interact with the ICP system API.

- [`ic-cdk-macros`](https://crates.io/crates/ic-cdk-macros): Defines the procedural macros (e.g., `update`, `query`, `import`) that facilitate building operation endpoints and APIs.

- [`ic-cdk-timers`](https://crates.io/crates/ic-cdk-timers): Provides an API to schedule timers and periodic tasks.

Other crates for specific features exist, such as [ic-stable-structures](https://crates.io/crates/ic-stable-structures) and [ic-certification](https://crates.io/crates/ic-certification).

## How to get started with Rust

To start building ICP dapps with Rust, you will need to either [open a project in ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja/i?s=wJg05) or setup a local environment:

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Install the [IC SDK](/building-apps/getting-started/install).

3. Create a new Rust project (`dfx new my_project --type=rust`) or [download an example](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust).

### Rust example projects

There are several Rust example projects available for you to get started with or use as inspiration for your dapp.

The web IDE tool, [ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja/) offers several template projects that can be edited and deployed directly from your web browser.

If you'd like to develop in a local environment, you can download the [examples repo](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust) and navigate to the Rust subdirectory.

## Rust documentation

The Rust CDK documentation can be found on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ic-cdk).

The following documentation pages detail specific Rust workflows, best practices, and considerations:

- [Globally mutable state](canister-state.mdx).

- [Generating Candid for Rust canisters](generating-candid.mdx).

- [Inter-canister calls](intercanister.mdx).

- [Message inspection](message-inspect.mdx).

- [Rust limitations](rust-limitations.mdx).

- [Stable structures](stable-structures.mdx).

- [Upgrading Rust canisters](upgrading.mdx).
