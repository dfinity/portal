# Message inspection

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Rust"]} />

A canister can inspect an ingress message and decide to either accept or decline the message through the canister's HTTPS interface. If the message is accepted, the canister will execute it.

A canister that does not have a Wasm module installed will reject any ingress messages. If the canister does not implement `canister_inspect_message`, all ingress messages will be accepted.

The `canister_inspect_message` functionality should not be used for definitive access control. This is because it is executed by a single replica and does not go through [consensus](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34207558615956-Consensus), therefore its result could be spoofed by a malicious [boundary node](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34212818609684-ICP-Edge-Infrastructure). However, since it does not go through consensus and therefore does not cost cycles, a malicious user cannot use the method to drain cycles from your canister.

HTTP query calls, inter-canister calls, and management canister calls do not trigger `#[inspect_message]`.

Using the `canister_inspect_message` endpoint, the canister can invoke `ic0.accept_message : () → ()` to accept the message. You can learn more in the [IC interface specification](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec#ingress-message-inspection).

## `inspect_message`

The `canister_inspect_message` endpoint can be defined and exported by a Rust canister using `#[inspect_message]`.

The function within this attribute cannot have a return value, and a canister can only have one `canister_inspect_message` endpoint.

```rust
#[inspect_message]
fn inspect_message_function() {
    if /* some condition */ {
        ic_cdk::api::call::accept_message();
    } else {
        /* trap or simply not call accept_message to deny*/
    }
}
```
