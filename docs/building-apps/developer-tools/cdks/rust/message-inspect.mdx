# Message inspection

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Rust"]} />

A canister can inspect an ingress message and either accept or decline the message through the canister's HTTPS interface. If the message is accepted, the canister will execute it.

A canister that does not have a Wasm module installed will reject any ingress messages. If the canister does not implement `canister_inspect_message`, all ingress messages will be accepted.

The `canister_inspect_message` functionality should not be used for definitive access control. This is because it is executed by a single replica, without full consensus, and its result could be spoofed by a malicious boundary node. However, since it does not go through full consensus, a malicious user cannot drain cycles from your canister because you don’t pay the cost for the message going through consensus.

Using the `canister_inspect_message` endpoint, the canister can invoke `ic0.accept_message : () → ()` to accept the message.

You can learn more in the [IC interface specification](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec#ingress-message-inspection).

This guide will describe how to use `inspect_message` within a Rust canister.

## `inspect_message`

The `canister_inspect_message` entry point can be defined and exported by a Rust canister using `#[inspect_message]`.

The function within this attribute cannot have a return value, and a canister can only have one `canister_inspect_message` entry point.

```rust
#[inspect_message]
fn inspect_message_function() {
    if /* some condition */ {
        ic_cdk::api::call::accept_message();
    } else {
        /* trap or simply not call accept_message to deny*/
    }
}
```
