# Defining custom networks

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "dfx workflow"]} />

When developing multiple projects simultaneously, it can be beneficial to deploy each project to a different local network for simplicity or to support different development workflows. Custom networks can be configured with `dfx` at both the system-wide and project-specific levels.

## Defining system-wide networks in `networks.json`

Canisters in any project can be deployed to system-wide networks. System-wide custom networks can be configured in the `networks.json` configuration file for `dfx`.

To locate this file on your local system, use the `dfx` command:

```
dfx info networks-json-path
```

This will return the file path where your system's `networks.json` file is located, such as:

```
/Users/developer/.config/dfx/networks.json
```

### Default configuration

By default, this file contains the following configuration:

```json
{
    "local": {
        "replica": {
            "subnet_type": "application"
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if a `network.json` file is not defined locally, `dfx` will by default use the above configuration.

### Defining a custom network

To define a custom network, you can define a binding address in your `networks.json` to be `localhost` or any other domain name, such as:

```json
{
  "network_1": {
    "bind": "localhost:4943",
    "replica": {
      "subnet_type": "application"
    }
  }
}
```

To define multiple networks, use multiple definitions on different domain names:

```json
{
  "network_1": {
    "bind": "localhost:4943",
    "replica": {
      "subnet_type": "application"
    }
  },
  "network_2": {
    "bind": "127.0.0.1:4943",
    "replica": {
      "subnet_type": "application"
    }
  }
}
```

Then, to deploy to one of these networks, use the `--network` flag with `dfx deploy`, such as:

```
dfx deploy --network network_2
```

`dfx deploy` will display URLs in the format `<canister>.localhost:port` or `<network>:port/?canisterId=<canister>`:

```
  Frontend canister via browser
    poll_frontend: http://b77ix-eeaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai.localhost:4943/
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    poll_backend: http://by6od-j4aaa-aaaaa-qaadq-cai.localhost:4943/?id=bw4dl-smaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai
```

```
URLs:
  Frontend canister via browser
    poll_frontend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    poll_backend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=be2us-64aaa-aaaaa-qaabq-cai&id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
```

## Defining project-specific networks in `dfx.json`

Networks can also be defined in a project's `dfx.json` file. Only canisters within the project can be deployed to the networks defined in `dfx.json`.

Network definitions in the `dfx.json` file can have the following configuration components:

- `providers`: The network provider; can be `localhost` or any other domain name. Domain names must be a full URL, such as `https://domain.com`.
- `type`: The type of network, either `ephemeral` or `persistent`. Ephemeral networks do not retain the same IDs for canisters, while persistent networks will retain the same canister IDs.

To define a project-specific network, add a "networks" section to your `dfx.json` file such as:

```json
"networks": {
    "dev": {
      "providers": [
        "https://ic0.app"
      ],
      "type": "persistent"
    }
  }
```

If you are using a [cycles wallet](/docs/building-apps/canister-management/topping-up), be sure to deploy your cycles wallet to this custom network.

```
dfx identity --network dev set-wallet $(dfx identity --network ic get-wallet)
```

Then, deploy to the network:

```
dfx deploy --network dev
```
