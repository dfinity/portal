# Developer best practices: Reproducible builds

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Best practices"]} />

If you are using a canister that you did not develop yourself, you may want to verify that the canister is running the code that you expect it to be before giving it control to make important decisions for you, such as accepting ICP for a payment. Verifying a canister's code requires confirming that the Wasm module is the correct result of compiling the canister source code and that the canister is in fact running that Wasm module and not another Wasm module.

It is therefore recommended that canister authors ensure trusted and [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/definition/) of the Wasm module are possible from their source code. Such builds allow anyone to follow the same steps as the canister authors and yield the exact same Wasm module, which can then be compared to the Wasm module executing on ICP.

## Considerations for developers

When developing code meant to be reproducible, it is recommended to use [Docker or a similar technology](#build-environments-using-docker) to conveniently set up the operating system and the build tools and fix their versions for the user. If the build tools you are using don’t guarantee fully reproducible builds, Docker can also help by minimizing the differences in paths, environment variables, etc. The build tools and the base Docker image should be sourced from somewhere that the user can trust. Ideally, you want to minimize the number of dependencies, as the user may have to rebuild all of your dependencies to properly reproduce your build.

However, build tools aren’t perfect and may fail to ensure reproducible builds. If reproducibility is critical for your canister (e.g., it holds other users' funds), [test it](#testing-reproducibility).

## Obtaining the Wasm module hash

ICP does not allow you to access the Wasm module of an arbitrary canister. This is a design decision, as developers might want to keep some code private. However, ICP does allow anyone to access the SHA-256 of the Wasm module.

To obtain this hash, you must first note the principal of the canister whose code you want to check. For example, to check the code of the Internet Identity canister, the principal is `rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai`. Then, the easiest way to access this data is using [`dfx`](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install) from a command line using the following command:

```bash
dfx canister --network ic info rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai
```

This will return the controller(s) of the canister and the Wasm module hash:

```
Controllers: r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai
Module hash: 0x86ab08ea53e4da5bba4f27baa931e2edc5ab2a1f228c204a5340992c16389f66
```

You will need to run this command from a directory that contains a valid `dfx.json` file. If you don’t have such a directory, you can create one using `dfx new`.

Here, ICP tells us that the hash of the Wasm module of the `rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai` canister is `0x86ab08ea53e4da5bba4f27baa931e2edc5ab2a1f228c204a5340992c16389f66`.

The check above provides you the **current** hash of the canister’s Wasm module, but the **controllers** of a canister may change the code at any time, such as to upgrade the canister. However, if the list of controllers is empty or the only controller is a [blackhole](https://github.com/ninegua/ic-blackhole) canister, you know that the canister is immutable since no one has the power to change the code.

## Verifying the build is reproducible

Next, check whether this hash corresponds to some given source code. This only works if the build process for the code is reproducible.

As a canister author, there are a few things you have to provide to your users to allow them to reproduce your build:

-   The same source code that you used to create the Wasm module for the canister.

-   Instructions on how to recreate your build environment.

-   Instructions on how to repeat the process of building the Wasm from the source code. The process must be deterministic to ensure that it results in the exact same Wasm. It also has to be trusted, such that the user can be convinced that the Wasm is a faithful translation of the source code and not an artifact of a malicious build tool. In particular, look for `.dfx`, `node_modules`, and `target` directories that could contain prebuilt files.

### Providing the source code

Typically, it is recommended that developers version your code in `git` or some other version control system, and versioned code may be available in a public repository such as GitHub. In this case, as the developer, you should note the particular commit that was used when producing the code that has been deployed to ICP and communicate it to the users who may want to verify your canister. Alternatively, you can also provide a package (i.e., a zip file or a tarball) containing the source code you used to build your canister.

### Reproducing build environments

Before building your code, you should document the build environment you are using in detail. In particular, for the languages supported by the IC SDK (Motoko, Rust, TypeScript, Python):

-   Note your local machine's operating system and its version.

-   If you are using the IC SDK, note the version used. You can install arbitrary versions of the IC SDK using [`dfxvm`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfxvm/dfxvm-install).

-   If you are building Motoko code in a way other than `dfx build`, note the version of `moc` you are using.

-   If you are building Rust, note the version of `cargo` you are using.

- If you are building TypeScript, note the version of [Azle](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/).

- If you are building Python, note the version of Python and [Kybra](https://demergent-labs.github.io/kybra/).

-   If you are using a framework for frontend development, such as React, Vite, or webpack, note their versions.

-   If your build process depends on any environment variables (such as the timezone or locale), note them.

You should communicate all of these to your user in the reproducible build instructions. Ideally, provide an executable recipe or script to recreate the build environment using tools such as Docker or Nix. It is recommended to use Docker, as it allows you to also pinpoint the operating system used for building the software.

### Build environments using Docker

[Docker containers](https://docs.docker.com/) are a popular solution for providing reproducible build environments.

:::info
For developers using macOS, it is recommended to install Docker using [lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima), as it proves more stable than Docker Desktop or Docker Machine. In particular, it avoids some QEMU bugs on Apple M1 machines.
:::

After setting Docker up, you can use a `Dockerfile` to provide the user with a particular version of the operating system, as well as other necessary tooling, such as `dfx`, Node.js, and the Rust toolchain.

:::caution
It is advised to stick with `x86_64` for running the Docker container, as builds are generally not reproducible across architectures. See the [docs](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/docs/multi-arch.md) on setting up cross-platform Docker containers in case your host environment is not `x86_64`.
:::

Below is an example Dockerfile that creates a standardized Rust build environment.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM ubuntu:22.04

ENV NVM_DIR=/root/.nvm
ENV NVM_VERSION=v0.39.1
ENV NODE_VERSION=18.1.0

ENV RUSTUP_HOME=/opt/rustup

ENV DFX_VERSION=0.23.0

# Install the basic environment needed for our build tools.
RUN apt -yq update && \
    apt -yqq install --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates \
        build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev llvm-dev liblmdb-dev clang cmake rsync

RUN . "${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh" && nvm install ${NODE_VERSION}

    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown &&\
    cargo install ic-wasm

# Install dfx
RUN sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"

COPY . /canister
WORKDIR /canister
```

#### What this does

There are a couple of things worth noting about this `Dockerfile`:

-   It starts from an official Docker image, such that all the installed tools are standard and come from standard sources. This provides the user with confidence that the build environment hasn’t been tampered with, and thus that the build process using Docker can be trusted.

-   To ensure that specific versions of the build tools are installed, it installs them directly rather than through a package manager. Package managers usually don’t provide a way of pinning the build tools to specific versions.

To use this `Dockerfile`, get Docker [up and running](https://docs.docker.com), place the `Dockerfile` in the project directory of your canister, and create the Docker container by running:

```bash
docker build -t mycanister .
```

This creates a Docker container image called `mycanister`, with Node.js, Rust, and `dfx` installed in it. Your canister source code will be copied to the directory `/canister`. You should invoke `docker build` from the canister project directory. You can then enter an interactive shell inside of your Docker container by running:

```bash
docker run -it --rm mycanister
```

From here, you can experiment with the steps needed to build your canister. Once you are confident that the steps are deterministic, you can also put them in the `Dockerfile`. For example, to run a build script, add the line:

```dockerfile
RUN ./build_script.sh
```

You can see an example in the [Dockerfile of the Internet Identity canister](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/397d0087a29855564c47f0fd3323f60b5b67a8fa/Dockerfile).

### Example build script

Below is an example script that can be used to programmatically build a Rust project:

:::info
This is an example build script for a Rust project and does not include a fully comprehensive example of what a build script may contain, nor does it include build instructions for other languages such as Motoko.
:::

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# additional setup, e.g., build frontend assets:
# ...
# Rust build:
export RUSTFLAGS="--remap-path-prefix $(readlink -f $(dirname ${0}))=/build --remap-path-prefix ${CARGO_HOME}=/cargo"
cargo build --locked --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
ic-wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/example_backend.wasm -o example_backend.wasm shrink
```

A build script such as the one above can be specified as a custom build script in `dfx.json`:

```json title="dfx.json"
"canisters": {
  "example_backend": {
    "candid": "src/example_backend/example_backend.did",
    "package": "example_backend",
    "type": "custom",
    "wasm": "./example_backend.wasm",
    "build": "./build_script.sh"
  }
}
```


### Ensuring the determinism of the build process

Next, consider if it is necessary to make the build deterministic. For the build process to be deterministic:

- #### Step 1: You will need to ensure that any dependencies of your canister are always resolved in the same way. Most build tools support a way of pinning dependencies to a particular version.

For `npm`, running `npm install` will create a `package-lock.json` file with some fixed versions of all (transitive) dependencies of your project that satisfy the requirements specified in your `package.json`. However, `npm install` will overwrite the `package-lock.json` file every time it is invoked. Thus, once you are ready to create the final version of your canister, run `npm install` only once. After that, commit `package-lock.json` to your version control system. Finally, when checking the build for reproducibility, use `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.

For Rust code, Cargo will automatically generate a `Cargo.lock` file with the fixed versions of your (transitive) dependencies. Like with `package-lock.json`, you should commit this file to your version control system once you are ready to produce the final version of your canister. Furthermore, Cargo by default ignores the locked versions of dependencies. Pass the `--locked` flag to the `cargo` command to ensure that the locked dependencies are used.

- #### Step 2: Your own build scripts must not introduce non-determinism.

Sources of non-determinism include randomness, timestamps, concurrency, or code obfuscators. Less obvious sources include locales, absolute file paths, the order of files in a directory, and remote URLs whose content can change. Furthermore, relying on third-party build plug-ins exposes you to any non-determinism introduced by these.

- #### Step 3: Given the same dependencies and deterministic build scripts, the build tools themselves (`moc` for Motoko, `cargo` for Rust, `npx` for TypeScript, `pip` for Python, or `webpack` for frontend development) must also be deterministic.

These tools aim to be deterministic. However, they are complicated pieces of software, and ensuring determinism is nontrivial. Thus, non-determinism bugs can and do occur.

#### Motoko deterministic considerations

The Motoko compiler aims to be deterministic and reproducible; if you find reproducibility issues, please submit a [new issue](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/issues/new/choose), and the team will try to address them to the extent possible.

#### Rust deterministic considerations

For Rust, see the [list of current potential non-determinism issues in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-reproducibility). If you have observed differences between Rust code compiled to Wasm under Linux and macOS, it is recommended to pin the build platform and its version.

#### Webpack deterministic considerations

For webpack, [deterministic naming of module and chunk IDs](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/) that you should use has been introduced since version 5.

### Testing reproducibility

If reproducibility is vital for your code, you should test the build to increase your confidence in its reproducibility. The tool [reprotest](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reprotest) can help you automate reproducibility tests, as it tests your build by running it in two different environments that differ in characteristics such as paths, time, file order, and others, and comparing the results. To check your build with `reprotest`, add the following line to your `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
RUN apt -yqq install --no-install-recommends reprotest disorderfs faketime rsync sudo wabt
```

When using `dfx build --network ic`, you need to prebuild your frontend dependencies by running `npm ci` before `dfx build --network ic` or by setting the custom build type in `dfx.json` and running `npm ci` in your build script. Your project directory should contain a `canister_ids.json` file containing the IDs of your canisters on the mainnet. Below is an example `canister_ids.json` file:

```json title="canister_ids.json"
{
  "example_backend": {
    "ic": "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai"
  },
  "example_frontend": {
    "ic": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
  }
}
```

Now, from the root directory of your canister project, you can test the reproducibility of your build using the commands:

```
docker build -t mycanister .
docker run --rm --privileged -it mycanister
/canister# mkdir artifacts
/canister# reprotest -vv --store-dir=artifacts --variations '+all,-time' 'dfx build --network ic' '.dfx/ic/canisters/*/*.wasm'
```

#### What this does
- The first command builds the Docker container using the `Dockerfile` provided earlier.
- The second command opens an interactive shell in the container, indicated by the flag `-it`. You can run this in privileged mode using the `--privileged` flag, as `reprotest` uses kernel modules for some build environment variations. You can also run it in non-privileged mode by excluding some of the variations; see the [reprotest manual](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/reprotest/reprotest.1.en.html). The `--rm` flag will destroy the container after you close its shell.
- Once inside the container, a directory is created for the build artifacts, and `reprotest` is launched in verbose mode using the `-vv` flags. You need to give it the build command you want to run as the first argument; in this example it is `dfx build --network ic`. It will then run the build in two different environments.
- Finally, you need to tell `reprotest` which paths to compare at the end of the two builds. In this example, it compares the Wasm code for all canisters, which is found in the `.dfx/ic` directory. It is encouraged that you compare the artifacts produced by 'reprotest` while manually changing your system time.

:::info
This workflow omits the time variation because the Rust compiler uses `jemalloc` for dynamic memory allocation, and this library is not [compatible](https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime/issues/130) with `faketime` used by `reprotest` to implement the time variation.
:::

If the comparison doesn’t find any differences, you will see an output similar to this one:

```
=======================
Reproduction successful
=======================
No differences in ./.dfx/ic/canisters/*/*.wasm
6b2a15a918219138836e88e9c95f9c5d2d7b6d465df83ae05d6fd2b0f14f8a97  ./.dfx/ic/canisters/example_backend/example_backend.wasm
a047686c1d517e21d447bcd42c9394a12cdb240e06425b830c99d3a689b5ee20  ./.dfx/ic/canisters/example_frontend/assetstorage.wasm
a047686c1d517e21d447bcd42c9394a12cdb240e06425b830c99d3a689b5ee20  ./.dfx/ic/canisters/example_frontend/example_frontend.wasm
```

This is a good indicator that your build is not affected by your environment.

:::info
Note that `reprotest` can’t check that your dependencies are pinned properly. It is recommended that you run the container `reprotest` builds under several host operating systems and compare the results. If the comparison does find differences between the Wasm code produced in two builds, it will output a diff. You will then likely want to use the `--store-dir` flag of `reprotest` to store the outputs and the diff somewhere where you can analyze them. If you are struggling to achieve reproducibility, consider also using [DetTrace](https://github.com/dettrace/dettrace), which is a container abstraction that tries to make arbitrary builds deterministic.
:::

Finally, if your build is reproducible, you can compare the hash of the resulting Wasm code to the hash of the code that is running in a canister, which you retrieve as follows:

```
dfx canister --network ic info <canister-id>
```

Beware that this hash might change if the controllers upgrade the canister code.

## Long-term considerations

Even after you achieve reproducibility for your builds, there are still other things to consider for the long term.

Reproducibility can be more demanding if you expect your canister code to stay around for years and remain reproducible. The biggest challenges are to ensure that your:

-  Build toolchain is available in the future.

-  Dependencies are available.

-  Toolchain still runs and correctly builds your dependencies.

Distributions and package archives may drop old versions of packages, including both your toolchain and their dependencies. Websites may go offline, and URLs might stop working. It’s prudent to back up all of your toolchain and dependencies. You should consider getting involved in projects such as [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/), which do this on a large scale.

You might have to adjust your build process to ensure that your canister still builds. Even if the build changes, if it still yields the same result, your users can be confident that your canister is running the correct code. The trust argument is easier if your dependencies come from a trustworthy source, such as the Software Heritage project.
