# IC Pack: package manager for apps

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Developer tools", "Feature or tool detail page"]} />

**IC Pack** (see more docs [here](https://dev.package-mananger.com)) is a package manager for IC apps, akin to Google Play or Apple App Store. Don't confuse IC Pack with package managers for software libraries such as [MOPS](https://mops.one) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

IC Pack has not been released yet, but some docs already were released, so that you can start building with it.

The thing that you can now, is to create an app with a TypeScript (or JavaScript) script that creates your own app store and package your app into it. See [this](https://dev.package-manager.com/sources/prepare-test.ts.html) example:

* You first create the repository (and optionally set its properties such as name).
* Then you upload WASM files of your app.
* Then you create a package, that can be installed using IC Pack from your repository (app store).
