# Create

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Developing canisters"]} />

Canisters are created with [`dfx canister create`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-create). They are initially empty and do not contain program code. The code must be [compiled](/docs/building-apps/developing-canisters/what-are-canisters) into Wasm and [installed](/docs/building-apps/developing-canisters/what-are-canisters) into the empty canister before it can be deployed.

Settings can be configured while creating a canister using optional flags. [View the full list of settings](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-create).

:::info
Canister creation is done automatically in the background of the `dfx deploy` command. However, there may be certain workflows where creating an empty canister is necessary.
:::

Create a canister from within a project's directory:

```
dfx canister create <canister-name> --network=<NETWORK>
```


When a canister is created, the following steps happen:

- A canister ID is registered with the local replica or the mainnet for each canister in the project's `dfx.json` file. Each canister ID is returned to the command line.

- The following canister components are created:
  - List of controllers.
  - Cycles balance.
  - Reserved cycles balance.
  - Canister status.
  - Resource reservations.
