# What is a subnet?

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Launching dapps"]} />

Internet Computer **subnet blockchains** are formed by a number of independently owned and controlled high-performance hardware devices called **nodes** that run the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) **replica**.

The replica is implemented by a number of software components that, as a bundle, replicate state and computation across all of the nodes in a subnet blockchain.

Each subnet can communicate with other subnets and is controlled by the **root subnet**, which uses [chain-key](/docs/current/concepts/glossary#c) cryptography to delegate its authority to the various subnets.

Subnets allow ICP to scale indefinitely. The problem with traditional blockchains (and individual subnets) is that they are limited by the computing power of a single node machine because every node has to run everything that happens on the blockchain to participate in the [consensus](/docs/current/concepts/glossary#c) algorithm. Running multiple independent subnets in parallel allows the Internet Computer to break through this single-machine barrier.

Not every canister has the same security, size, or feature requirements, therefore not every subnet has the same configuration. The `system` subnet (which contains the [NNS](/docs/current/concepts/glossary#n) and several other critical services), for example, does not charge any cycles for its canisters, because those canisters should be available in all circumstances. Other subnets can have different features enabled or disabled, such as the subnet running the canisters for the Bitcoin integration.

At the time of writing, there are two main subnet types: `system` and `application`. Almost all canisters run on application subnets. In comparison with the `application` subnet, the `system` subnet has the following characteristics:
- No cycles accounting takes place.
- More generous per-call instruction limit.
- More generous Wasm module size limit.

## Replica architecture

The core components of the replica are organized into the following logical layers:

-   A **peer-to-peer** (P2P) networking layer that collects and advertises messages from users, other nodes in the same subnet, and nodes on other subnets. Messages received by the peer-to-peer layer are replicated to all of the nodes in the subnet to ensure security, reliability, and resiliency.

-   A **consensus** layer that selects and sequences messages received from users and different subnets to create blockchain blocks that can be notarized and finalized by Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus, forming the evolving blockchain. These finalized blocks are delivered to the message routing layer.

-   A **message routing** layer that routes user- and system-generated messages between subnets, manages the input and output queues for dapps, and schedules messages for execution.

-   An **execution environment** that calculates the deterministic computation involved in executing a smart contract by processing the messages it receives from the message routing layer.

The following diagram provides a simplified overview of the Internet Computer blockchain protocol components deployed as a local canister execution environment:

:::info
As a developer, it isn’t necessary to know the details about how your dapps and user interactions with your dapps are routed through the Internet Computer blockchain architecture or replicated on the blockchain network. However, a general understanding of the key components can be useful because `dfx` includes an instance of the replica to provide a local execution environment that resembles the mainnet production environment.

## Deploying canisters to subnets

When a canister is deployed to the mainnet, it will be deployed to a random subnet that has resources available to host that canister. However, you can specify the subnet your canister is deployed on using flags such as `--subnet` or `--next-to`. [Learn more about deploying to specific subnets](/docs/current/building-apps/creating-dapps/subnets/subnet-types).

## Viewing canisters in a subnet

To view all <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip> currently deployed on a subnet, there are two methods that can be used:

1. Use the [ICP Dashboard UI](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canisters?s=25&subnet=tdb26-jop6k-aogll-7ltgs-eruif-6kk7m-qpktf-gdiqx-mxtrf-vb5e6-eqe).

2. Make a call to the [ICP API](https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/swagger).
