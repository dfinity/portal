# Chain Fusion examples

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Chain Fusion" ]} />

ICP's Chain Fusion technology allows developers to build dapps that can interact seamlessly with other blockchain networks without using an intermediary, such as an oracle or a bridge.

ICP currently has a direct infrastructure integration with the Bitcoin network, an RPC integration with Ethereum and EVM-based chains, and support for making calls to other chains, such as Sui, through the [HTTPS outcalls](/docs/building-apps/network-features/using-http/https-outcalls/overview) and [Threshold ECDSA](/docs/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-ecdsa) features.

This page highlights both DFINITY-contributed and community-contributed tooling and example projects that showcase how Chain Fusion technology can be implemented for various different use cases.
