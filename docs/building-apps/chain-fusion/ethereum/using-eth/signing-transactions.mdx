# Signing transactions

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Ethereum", "Tutorial"]} />

Before a transaction can be sent to the Ethereum network, it must be signed and formatted into a raw ETH transaction. Transactions are signed with [threshold ECDSA](/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-ecdsa). For this example, the transaction standard EIP1559 will be used.

## Build a transaction

First, a raw EIP1559 ETH transaction must be built containing the transaction's metadata, such as gas fee, sender, receiver, and transaction data. Below is a programmatic example of how to build a transaction using Rust:

```rust reference
https://github.com/letmejustputthishere/icp-evm-coprocessor-starter/blob/main/packages/ic-evm-utils/src/eth_send_raw_transaction.rs#L45-L77
```

## Format, hash, and sign a transaction

Ethereum EIP1559 transactions are first hashed with the Keccak256 algorithm and then signed using the private key. Below is an example written in Rust demonstrating how to format a raw ETH transaction, hash it using Keccak256 and sign the hash using threshold ECDSA. This code snippet accomplishes the following:

- Formats the transaction.

- Hashes the transaction using Keccak256.

- Signs the Keccak hash.

- Rebuilds the transaction using the VRS signature.

```rust reference
https://github.com/letmejustputthishere/chain-fusion-starter/blob/main/packages/ic-evm-utils/src/evm_signer.rs#L56-L94
```

Additional examples of signing transactions with threshold ECDSA can be found in the [threshold ECDSA documentation](/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-ecdsa).

## Submit transaction

Now that your transaction is signed, it can be submitted to Ethereum to be executed.
