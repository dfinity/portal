# Signing transactions

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Bitcoin", "Tutorial"]} />

Before a transaction can be sent to the Bitcoin network, each input must be signed.

## Threshold ECDSA

Canisters can sign transactions with threshold ECDSA through the
`sign_with_ecdsa` method.

:::info

To test canisters locally that use the following code snippets, you will need to enable local Bitcoin development. To do this, you can either start the local replica with `dfx start --enable-bitcoin` or you can include the following configuration in the project's `dfx.json` file:

```json reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/motoko/basic_bitcoin/dfx.json#L9-L16
```

[Learn more about `dfx.json` configuration options](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx-json-reference).

The following snippet shows a simplified example of how to sign a Bitcoin transaction for the special case where all the inputs are referencing outpoints that are owned by `own_address` and `own_address` is a `P2PKH` address.

## Threshold Schnorr

Canisters can sign transactions with threshold Schnorr through the
`sign_with_schnorr` method.

### Signing P2TR key path transactions

The following snippet shows a simplified example of how to sign a Bitcoin
transaction for the special case where all the inputs are referencing outpoints
that are owned by `own_address` and `own_address` is a `P2TR` address.
