# Runes

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Bitcoin", "Tutorial"]} />

Bitcoin Runes are a type of fungible asset deployed on the Bitcoin network. Runes are not reliant on the [Ordinals protocol](ordinals.mdx) unlike other Bitcoin asset standards such as BRC-20 and SRC-20. Runes are designed to be an efficient and simple asset that utilizes Bitcoin's UTXO model and the `OP_RETURN` opcode. Although Runes aren't reliant on Ordinals, the Rune protocol was created and implemented by the same creator and is part of the same open source project that Ordinals are.

The UTXO transaction model enables each transaction's output to hold information and be treated as digital currency. To initiate a transaction, you must use those outputs as your transaction's input. For Runes specifically, each UTXO can hold a different amount or type of Rune, simplifying the management of tokens on Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin opcode `OP_RETURN` enables additional information to be attached to a Bitcoin transaction, up to 80 bytes of data. Runes use this `OP_RETURN` value to store the token's data, such as name, symbol, commands, or ID. This token data is referred to as the 'Runestone.'

Creating a Rune is done through a process called 'etching,' which refers to submitting a transaction to the Bitcoin network that specifies the Rune's data in the `OP_RETURN` output of a transaction. Once a Rune has been etched, it can be minted through open or closed mints. Open minting allows anyone to mint an instance of the Rune through a mint transaction, while closed minting refers to a set of requirements that must be met in order for the Rune to be minted. When a Rune is initially etched, the creator can set aside a portion of the Runes for themselves before others are minted.

## Runes on ICP

Canisters deployed on ICP can sign and submit transactions directly to the Bitcoin network through ICP's [Bitcoin integration](../overview.mdx) and [threshold signatures](/docs/references/t-sigs-how-it-works). Specifically, for a canister to etch Runes, it must sign transactions using [threshold Schnorr signatures](/docs/references/t-sigs-how-it-works#deuterium-schnorr-release-beta) and have a [Bitcoin taproot address](/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/bitcoin/using-btc/generate-addresses#generating-addresses-with-threshold-schnorr).

## Etching and minting Runes

To etch a Rune through a canister on ICP, first you will need to call the `schnorr_public_key` API to obtain a Schnorr public key. This public key will be used to generate a Bitcoin taproot (P2TR) address for your canister. A taproot address is required to sign and submit Rune transactions, both etching and minting, on Bitcoin. [Learn more about Bitcoin taproot addresses](/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/bitcoin/using-btc/generate-addresses#generating-addresses-with-threshold-schnorr).

Once you have generated a taproot address for your canister, you will need to write a canister method that creates an etching transaction, then signs that transaction with your canister's Schnorr public key. Here's an example of an etching transaction written in Rust:

```rust reference
https://github.com/pramitgaha21/etcher/blob/ca6c9a1423a597b5f544470eb0e6f0954279b4a4/src/etcher_backend/src/lib.rs#L284-L323
```

## Querying Rune information

To query information about a Rune, you can use the [Runes Indexer canister](https://github.com/octopus-network/runes-indexer) created by [Omnity Network](https://omnity.network/). The Runes Indexer canister can be used to fetch Rune information, etching information for a specific Rune, and Rune balances. For example, to query data about a Rune using the Rune's name, you can make the following call to the Runes Indexer's `get_rune` method:

```
dfx canister call runes-indexer get_rune '("HOPEâ€¢YOUâ€¢GETâ€¢RICH")' --ic
```

Returns:

```json
(
  opt record {
    confirmations = 39_825 : nat32;
    mints = 81_000 : nat;
    terms = opt record {
      cap = opt (81_000 : nat);
      height = record { opt (840_001 : nat64); opt (844_609 : nat64) };
      offset = record { null; null };
      amount = opt (10_000_000 : nat);
    };
    etching = "d66de939cb3ddb4d94f0949612e06e7a84d4d0be381d0220e2903aad68135969";
    turbo = true;
    premine = 0 : nat;
    divisibility = 2 : nat8;
    spaced_rune = "HOPEâ€¢YOUâ€¢GETâ€¢RICH";
    number = 431 : nat64;
    timestamp = 1_713_571_767 : nat64;
    block = 840_000 : nat64;
    burned = 48_537_380 : nat;
    rune_id = "840000:846";
    symbol = opt "ðŸ§§";
  },
)
```
