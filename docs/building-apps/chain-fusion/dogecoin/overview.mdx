# Build on Dogecoin

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Dogecoin" ]} />

ICP brings smart contract functionality to Dogecoin and opens up new possibilities for dapp development.

Through a protocol-level integration with the Dogecoin network, smart contracts deployed on ICP can interact with the Dogecoin network directly without using a bridge or oracle.

Threshold signing APIs such as [threshold ECDSA](/docs/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-ecdsa) enables an ICP smart contract to hold assets like DOGE or [sign](/docs/build-on-btc/btc-transactions/sign-transactions) and [submit transactions](/docs/build-on-btc/btc-transactions/submit-transactions) to the Dogecoin network.

When an ICP smart contract wants to submit a Dogecoin transaction, the following steps may occur:

- Request a public key from the threshold signing APIs
- Create a Dogecoin address from the public key
- Read unspent UTXOs from the Dogecoin API
- Build the transaction payload
- Request a signature of the transaction hash from the threshold signing API
- Submit the transaction to the Dogecoin API

The Dogecoin API relays the request to the Dogecoin network, which receives and processes the request asynchronously before returning the result of the transaction to the ICP smart contract that initially created it.

ICP smart contracts can call the Dogecoin API to query the [Dogecoin mainnet](/docs/build-on-btc/btc-api) for network state information, UTXOs, block information, or the balance of any Dogecoin address.

## Additional resources

Building Dogecoin applications is not trivial. It’s beneficial to understand core Dogecoin concepts, including transactions, UTXOs, the Script language, and Dogecoin’s hash formats.
