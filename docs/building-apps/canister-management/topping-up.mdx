# Topping up a canister

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Management"]} />

A <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> needs to have cycles deposited continuously into it to pay for the resources it uses. This process is known as 'topping up' the canister. Topping up canisters is routine maintenance.

Anyone can top-up any canister deployed to ICP; you do not need to be the owner or controller of the canister. All you need is the canister's principal.

There are a few different ways to top-up canisters:

- Using [`dfx cycles top-up`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-cycles#dfx-cycles-top-up).

- Through the [NNS frontend dapp](https://nns.ic0.app).

- Through a [third-party service](/docs/building-apps/canister-management/topping-up) (e.g., https://cycleops.dev).

### Number of cycles

For ease of use, you can copy/paste the cycles amounts below:

| Cycles            | Number        |
| -----------       | -----------   |
| 1 million         | 1000000         |
| 10 million        | 10000000         |
| 100 million       | 100000000         |
| 1 billion         | 1000000000         |
| 10 billion        | 10000000000         |
| 100 billion       | 100000000000         |
| 1 trillion        | 1000000000000         |
| 10 trillion       | 10000000000000         |
| 100 trillion      | 100000000000000         |

## Canister top-up workflows

The following examples will demonstrate how to interact with and top-up a canister with the canister ID `jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai` with one trillion cycles (1000000000000) or one ICP's worth of cycles. These instructions will work for any canister ID or cycles/ICP amount.

### Checking the cycles balance of a canister

Canister cycles balances are available through the [`dfx canister status`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-status) command. They are not exposed publicly by default; you can only see them if you are the controller of a canister.

```bash
dfx canister status jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai --network=ic
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```bash
Canister status call result for jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai.

```

Canisters can check their balance programmatically.

<AdornedTabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

Motoko canisters can use the [ExperimentalCycles library](/docs/motoko/main/base/ExperimentalCycles) to interact with cycles.

Rust canisters can use the function `canister_balance128()` from the [Rust IC CDK](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/fn.canister_balance128.html).

### Option 1: If you have ICP on your account

If you have ICP associated with your [developer identity](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/identities) you can use [`dfx ledger top-up`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-ledger) to convert some ICP into cycles, then top-up a canister with those cycles:

### Option 2: If you have cycles

If you already have cycles, you can top-up a canister with the command [`dfx cycles top-up`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-cycles#dfx-cycles-top-up):

```bash
dfx cycles top-up jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai 1T --network ic
```

### Special case: topping up a cycles wallet

:::danger
The cycles wallet will be removed from `dfx` in a future release.

It is recommended to use the cycles ledger instead.
:::

Cycles wallets are canisters like any other. If you have a cycles wallet you control via `dfx`, there is another option for sending cycles from your cycles wallet to a canister of your choice: [`dfx wallet send [OPTIONS] <DESTINATION> <AMOUNT>`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-wallet#dfx-wallet-send).

[Learn more about the cycles wallet](cycles-wallet.mdx).

## Topping up a canister with the NNS frontend dapp

You can also top-up any canister via the [NNS frontend dapp](https://nns.ic0.app):

- #### Step 1: Navigate to the **My Canisters** section of the dapp.
- #### Step 2: Click **Link Canister**.
- #### Step 3: Add a canister principal. The user doesn't need to control the canister.
- #### Step 4: Once the canister is added, click on that canister.
- #### Step 5: Click `Add cycles` to add cycles using the ICP in your NNS frontend dapp.

## Managing cycle depletion with freezing threshold

ICP features a mechanism to prevent canisters from running out of cycles. Canisters have a configurable `freezing_threshold`, dynamically evaluated in cycles.

[Learn more about freezing thresholds](/docs/building-apps/canister-management/settings#freezing-threshold).

## Using a cycles management service

Cycles management services provide canister monitoring and automated cycles top-ups to ensure canister applications remain up and running and do not run out of cycles.

Instead of manually topping up a canister via `dfx` or scripting a custom solution, cycles management services provide tested top-up automation and canister metric insights.

Popular cycles management services include:

* [CycleOps](https://cycleops.dev): Onchain, proactive, no-code canister monitoring with historical trend graphs, top-up email notifications & downloadable transaction history.
* [TipJar](https://k25co-pqaaa-aaaab-aaakq-cai.ic0.app/): Donate cycles to your favorite canisters on the Internet Computer and keep them alive and healthy!
* [Canistergeek](https://cusyh-iyaaa-aaaah-qcpba-cai.raw.icp0.io/): Top up your canisters, monitor cycles, memory, and logs, and get your monthly reports in one place.

Popular cycles management libraries include:

### Motoko

* [cycles-manager](https://github.com/CycleOperators/cycles-manager): Provides a simplified, permissioned cycles management framework for multi-canister applications (sponsored by CycleOps).
* [canistergeek-ic-motoko](https://github.com/usergeek/canistergeek-ic-motoko): An open-source Motoko tool for Internet Computer to track your project canisters cycles and memory status and collect log messages.

### Rust
* [canfund](https://github.com/dfinity/canfund): An open-source library for automated cycles management of canisters on the Internet Computer.
* [canistergeek_ic_rust](https://github.com/usergeek/canistergeek_ic_rust): An open-source Rust tool for Internet Computer to track your project canisters cycles and memory status and collect log messages.

## Creating custom autonomous top-up solutions

To create an autonomous canister that doesn't rely on a third-party service, you can create your own autonomous canister top-up solution. One option is to use a similar architecture implemented by [CycleOps](https://github.com/CycleOperators/cycles-manager/tree/main), where one canister acts as the cycles manager for the project and provides the API used to request more cycles when a canister within the project has its cycles balance dip below a preset threshold. Below is a sample code for this architecture, where 'CyclesManager' is the management canister and 'Child' is another canister in the project that requests cycles from the 'CyclesManager'.
