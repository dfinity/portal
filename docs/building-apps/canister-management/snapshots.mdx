# Canister snapshots

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Management"]} />

A <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> is managed and maintained by **controllers**. A controller can be a single developer identity, a list of developer identities, or another canister. If a canister does not have a controller, it cannot be upgraded, deleted, or otherwise maintained. This also applies if access to all canister controller identities is lost. If a canister's code traps with an unrecoverable error and cannot be upgraded, the canister can potentially be recovered using canister snapshots or an NNS proposal.

One method for recovering a canister is to roll the canister back to a snapshot if one exists.

A <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> contains compiled Wasm code and data, such as the canister ID, settings, and Wasm memory. If a canister stops working as expected, traps, or simply needs to be rolled back to a previous version, the developer can use canister snapshots. Developers can take a snapshot of a stopped canister to save the canister's current stable memory, heap memory, data, and Wasm module. This snapshot can be loaded at a later date, rolling the canister back to the code and data saved within that snapshot.

Canister snapshots are supported in `dfx` version 0.23.0 and newer.

## Creating a snapshot

To create a snapshot, first the canister must be stopped. Then, use the [`dfx canister snapshot create <canister-name>`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-snapshot-create) command:

```
dfx canister stop <canister-name>
dfx canister snapshot create <canister-name>
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
Created a new snapshot of canister <canister-name>. Snapshot ID: 0000000000000000800000000010000a0101
```

</details>

Only a controller of a canister can take a snapshot or roll a canister back to a snapshot.

Currently, only one snapshot per canister can be saved. Taking another snapshot of a canister that already has a snapshot saved will overwrite the previous snapshot.

To take a snapshot of a canister on the mainnet, include the flag `--network ic` in the two commands shown above.

The snapshot ID can be used to load the snapshot at a later time. To list all snapshots saved for a canister, use the command [`dfx canister snapshot list <canister-name>`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-snapshot-list):

```
dfx canister snapshot list <canister-name>
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

0000000000000000800000000010000a0101: 2.39MiB, taken at 2024-09-16 19:40:23 UTC
```

</details>

## Loading a snapshot

To load a saved snapshot, first the canister must be stopped. Then, use the [`dfx canister snapshot load <canister-name> <snapshot-id>`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-snapshot-load) command:

```
dfx canister stop <canister-name>
dfx canister snapshot load <canister-name> <snapshot-id>
```

Loading a snapshot will replace the canister's current code and data with the snapshot code and data. Any new data that was added to the canister after the snapshot was taken will be deleted.

## Deleting snapshots

To delete a saved snapshot, use the command [`dfx canister snapshot delete <canister-name> <snapshot-id>`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-snapshot-delete)

```
dfx canister snapshot delete <canister-name> <snapshot-id>
```

## Errors related to canister snapshots

Common errors related to canister snapshots include:

- [Canister snapshot not found](/docs/references/execution-errors#canister-snapshot-not-found).

- [Canister snapshot invalid ownership](/docs/references/execution-errors#canister-snapshot-invalid-ownership).

## Recovering a canister that does not have controllers

If a canister is unable to be upgraded via any of the canister's existing controllers, either due to the canister not having controllers or loss of access to the canister's controllers, there is no supported method to recover that canister.
