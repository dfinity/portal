# Canister state

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Management"]} />

After you deploy a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>, it can begin receiving and processing requests from users and from other canisters. Canisters that are available to send requests and receive replies are considered to be in a **Running** state.

Although canisters are normally placed in the Running state by default, there are cases where you might want to temporarily or permanently stop a canister. For example, you might want to stop a canister before upgrading it. Stopping a canister helps to ensure proper handling of any messages that are in progress and need to either run to completion or be rolled back. You might also want to stop a canister to clear its message queue cleanly as a prerequisite to deleting the canister.

To modify the state of a canister:

- [`dfx canister status <canister-name>`](/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-status): Check if the canister is `Running`, `Stopping`, or `Stopped`. This command also returns details about the canister's settings.

- [`dfx canister stop <canister-name>`](/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-stop): Stop the canister. The canister's status will change to `Stopping` if it has in-flight messages that must be addressed before it can be stopped.

- [`dfx canister start <canister-name>`](/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-start): Start the canister. After a canister has been stopped with `dfx canister stop`, the only way to restart it is through `dfx canister start`. Other commands, such as `dfx deploy`, do not start the canister if it has been manually stopped.
