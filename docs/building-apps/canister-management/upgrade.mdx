# Upgrading a canister

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Management"]} />

Unlike a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> reinstall that preserves the canister identifier but no state, a canister upgrade enables you to preserve the state of a deployed canister and change the code.

For example, assume you have a dapp that manages professional profiles and social connections. If you want to add a new feature to the dapp, you need to be able to update the canister code without losing any of the previously-stored data. A canister upgrade enables you to update existing canister identifiers with program changes without losing the program state.

:::tip
To preserve state when you are upgrading a canister written in Motoko, be sure to use the `stable` keyword to identify the variables you want to preserve. For more information about preserving variable state in Motoko, see [stable variables and upgrade methods](/docs/motoko/main/canister-maintenance/upgrades).

To upgrade a canister, first you must:

1. Edit the canister's code and save the changes.

2. Use [`dfx build <canister-name>`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-build) to compile the code into a new Wasm module.

3. Use [`dfx canister install <canister-name> --mode upgrade`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-install) to install the new Wasm module.
