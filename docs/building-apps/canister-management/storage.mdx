# Canister storage

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Management"]} />

When developing projects on ICP, there are two primary forms of data storage that your <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip> can utilize. The first type of storage is the canister's **heap memory**, sometimes referred to as the canister's *main memory*. Heap memory is **temporary**, and any data stored in a canister's heap memory is cleared whenever the canister is reinstalled or upgraded.

The second type of storage available to a canister is **stable memory**. Stable memory is a unique feature of ICP that defines a separate data store aside from a canister's regular Wasm heap memory data storage. It is a secondary storage type that can be used to store data long-term, since all data stored in stable memory will persist across all canister processes.

## Heap memory

Heap memory refers to a canister's regular Wasm memory. It does not persist and does not store data long-term. A canister's heap memory is cleared whenever a canister is reinstalled or upgraded. Heap memory is used by default for storing things such as variable values, the result of an executed function, or other arguments passed to your canister.

Heap memory is limited to a maximum of 4GiB of data.

## Stable memory

Stable memory is a feature unique to the Internet Computer Protocol that provides a long-term, persistent data storage option separate from a canister's heap memory. Unless a canister is reinstalled, uninstalled, or its data is cleared due to cycle depletion, the data stored in stable memory is not cleared or removed. The stable memory is preserved throughout the process, while any other WebAssembly state is discarded.

To use stable memory, you must anticipate which portions of the canister's data you want to persist across upgrades by indicating this within the canister code. More information about this can be found in the section below, [Storage handling in different languages](#storage-handling-in-different-languages).

By default, a canister's stable memory is empty. The maximum storage limit for stable memory is 500GiB if the <GlossaryTooltip>subnet</GlossaryTooltip> the canister is deployed on can accommodate it.

## Storage cost

Storage cost is calculated based on the GiB of storage used by a canister per second, costing `127_000` <GlossaryTooltip>cycles</GlossaryTooltip> on a 13-node [subnet](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34209955782420-Subnet-Creation) and `127_000 / 13 * 34` cycles on a subnet with 34 nodes. In USD, this works out to about $0.43 and $1.13, respectively, for storing 1 GiB of data for a 30-day month. The cost is the same whether the canister is using heap memory, stable memory, or both.

## Storage handling in different languages

### Motoko storage handling

In Motoko canisters, stable memory can be utilized through the Motoko **stable storage** and **stable variable** features. Stable storage is a Motoko-specific term used to refer to Motoko's implementation of stable memory to persist data across canister upgrades. Stable variables are Motoko-defined variables that use the `stable` modifying keyword to indicate that the variable's value should persist across canister upgrades, such as:

```motoko
actor Counter {
  stable var value = 0;
  public func inc() : async Nat {
    value += 1;
    return value;
  };
}
```

To utilize stable memory when upgrading a Motoko canister, the following workflow is used:

- The canister must be stopped.
- The canister's heap memory is discarded, and a new version of the canister's Wasm module is initialized. Data stored in stable memory is made available to the new Wasm module.
- The canister's new code is installed using the `--mode upgrade` flag.
- The canister is started and now runs the newly upgraded code.
- Stable variables are reloaded. Stable memory bytes that store those variables are overwritten with zeros to minimize stable memory costs for the canister.

#### Garbage collection

A garbage collection process is an automatic utility that is used to manage the amount of memory used. For heap memory, garbage collection is used to remove unreferenced or dead objects in order to free up otherwise allocated heap memory.

In Motoko, the default garbage collection process uses a copying approach, which depends on the size of the amount of heap memory currently used. In contrast, an additional garbage collector that uses a marking approach can be selected, which is based on the amount of free heap memory. These garbage collection methods are triggered when there are enough changes made to heap memory since the last round of garbage collection. Garbage collection can be forced to run after every message using the `--force-gc` flag in the project's `dfx.json` file:

```json
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "packtool": "",
      "args": "--force-gc"
    }
  },
```

Both of these garbage collectors, however, are unable to collect the entire heap memory pool due to the instruction limit per message on ICP. Since these garbage collectors cannot collect the entire heap memory pool, canisters do not benefit from fully utilizing the entire 4GiB memory pool, as there must be some heap memory space left for the garbage collector to operate.

A beta incremental garbage collection process is available, which uses incremental messages that distribute the garbage collection work across multiple messages when needed. This form of garbage collection allows for the allocation of up to 3x more heap space after it has been run while consuming fewer cycles on average. Using this garbage collection service, canisters can benefit from using the entire 4GiB of heap memory, as it can garbage collect the entire heap memory pool.

The incremental garbage collector can be used by specifying the `--incremental-gc` compiler flag in a project's `dfx.json` file, such as:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    “my_dapp”: {
       "main": "src/my-dapp.mo",
       "type": "motoko",
       "args" : "--incremental-gc"
    },
  },
}
```

:::info
This garbage collector is still in beta testing and should be used with caution.

### Rust storage handling

To utilize stable memory for canisters written in Rust, the crate [ic-stable-structures](https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures) can be used. It is recommended to review the documentation for these crates to learn more or [review the tutorial on the stable structures crate](https://mmapped.blog/posts/14-stable-structures.html).

As good practice, stable memory should be versioned since the stable memory decoding mechanism may need to guess the data's format in situations where the serialization format or stable data layout of a canister drastically changes. This can be as simple as declaring that the first byte of the canister's stable memory will be used to represent the version number.

To utilize stable memory when upgrading a Rust canister, the following workflow is used:

- The canister must be stopped.
- The canister's heap memory is discarded, and a new version of the canister's Wasm module is initialized. Data stored in stable memory is made available to the new Wasm module.
- The canister's new code is installed using the `--mode upgrade` flag.
- The canister has been started and now runs the newly upgraded code. The init function is not executed.
