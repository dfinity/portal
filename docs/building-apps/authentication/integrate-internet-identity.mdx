# Integrating Internet Identity

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

This guide demonstrates an example of how to integrate Internet Identity as an application authentication service. In this example, a user can interact with the application's website to log in with their identity and then call a backend canister's function whose behavior depends on the identity of the caller.

For simplicity, we use the `whoami` function that simply returns the caller's principal. (While real-world use cases for Internet Identity are out of scope of this guide, note that the most common use case is *authentication*, for example, letting the backend process certain requests only from an authorized caller while rejecting calls from everyone else.)

### Step 1: Create or open a project.

First, use `dfx start` to start a [local development environment](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-start) (if necessary) and [create a new project](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-new) or open an existing project.

Alternatively, you can open this project in [ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja/projects/who-am-i), a web-based IDE for temporary project deployments, or [clone the "Who am I?" sample from GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/motoko/who_am_i).

#### Creating a new project

Create a new project with the command:

```
dfx new internet_identity_app --type=motoko --frontend react --extras internet-identity
cd internet_identity_app
```

:::info
To use a Rust backend canister, use `--type=rust` instead.
:::

The `--extras` flag will add the *pullable* version of the Internet Identity canister to your project. A pullable canister is a canister that provides a public service at a static canister ID. [Learn more about pullable canisters](/docs/building-apps/advanced/using-third-party-canisters).

#### Using an existing project

If you already have a project that was not created with the extra Internet Identity feature, you can modify the project to use the pullable Internet Identity canister.
First, add the canister configuration to the project's `dfx.json` file:

```json no-repl reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/motoko/who_am_i/dfx.json
```

### Step 2: Create a "Who am I" function.

To add a simple "Who am I?" function, insert the following code into the backend canister's source code file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

```motoko no-repl reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/motoko/who_am_i/src/internet_identity_app_backend/main.mo
```

Note that the Motoko standard library requires the [Mops package manager](https://cli.mops.one/).
After installing Mops, make sure your project has a mops.toml file in its root, e.g., by running `mops init -y`.

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust no-repl reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/rust/who_am_i/backend/lib.rs
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Step 3: Edit frontend code.

In the frontend canister code, add a method to the `App` class to call the backend function and initialize the auth client:

```js no-repl reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/motoko/who_am_i/src/internet_identity_app_frontend/src/App.jsx
```

:::warning

Make sure to always create a single `AuthClient` instance on page load and reuse it within your click handlers.

:::

:::info

If you are developing using the Safari web browser, you need to change the value returned for the local development environment to `http://localhost:4943?canisterId=<canister_id>`.

:::

Install the required `npm` package:

```bash
npm install @dfinity/auth-client
```

:::caution

Make sure that all **@dfinity/&lt;package&gt;** dependencies in **package.json** are the same version.

:::


### Step 4: Deploy the application:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

Open the frontend URL that is returned in the deployment output. Your dapp's frontend will be displayed.

Click the "Login" button. You'll be redirected to the Internet Identity frontend. Since you're running this locally, you will be using a local, non-production Internet Identity. To create one, follow the on-screen steps.

Click the "Who am I" button and it should return your Internet Identity principal:

```
Your principal is: 5uylz-j7fcd-isj73-gp57f-xwwyy-po2ib-7iboa-fdkdv-nrsam-3bd3r-qqe
```

:::info

The above principal is an example. The principal returned will be different based on the account and the environment where the application and Internet Identity are running.

:::

## Local frontend development

When modifying this example's frontend, it is recommended to develop using a local development server instead of using the deployed frontend canister. This is because using a local development server will enable Hot Module Reloading, allowing you to see any modifications made to your frontend instantaneously, rather than having to redeploy the frontend canister to see the changes.

To start a local development server, run `npm run start`. The output will contain the local address the project is running at, such as `127.0.0.1:4943`.
