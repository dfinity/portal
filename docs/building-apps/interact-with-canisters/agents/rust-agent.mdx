# ICP Rust agent

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Agents" ]} />

The [ICP Rust agent](https://docs.rs/ic-agent/latest/ic_agent/) by DFINITY is a simple library that enables you to build applications and interact with ICP, serving as a low-level Rust backend for the IC SDK.

The agent is designed to be compatible with multiple versions of the replica API, exposing both low-level APIs for communicating with components like the replica and higher-level APIs for communicating with software applications deployed as canisters.

One example of an implementation of the ICP Rust agent is [`dfx`](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk).

## Adding the agent as a dependency

To add the ICP Rust agent crate as a dependency in your project, use the command:

```
cargo add ic-agent
```

## Initializing the agent

Before using the agent in your project, it must be initialized using the `Agent::builder()` function. Here is an example of how to initialize the Rust agent:

```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use ic_agent::Agent;

pub async fn create_agent(url: &str, use_mainnet: bool) -> Result<Agent> {
    let agent = Agent::builder().with_url(url).build()?;
    if !use_mainnet {
        agent.fetch_root_key().await?;
    }
    Ok(agent)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // URL of the IC HTTP Gateway
    let url = "https://ic0.app";
    // alternatively, specify URL of some API boundary node
    // NOTE: you need to discover correct domain names first
    // let url = "https://<api-boundary-node-domain>";

    let agent = create_agent(url, true).await?;

    // Example of how you'd use the agent:
    // let response = agent.query(canister_id, method_name).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

This instantiates the agent with static routing, which dispatches all requests to a single endpoint (in this case `ic0.app`).

### Static vs dynamic routing

By default, the Rust agent uses static routing, sending all API calls to a single, fixed URL. This URL can either point to:
- A specific API boundary node (which may be unreliable due to maintenance etc.)
- A fleet of HTTP gateways that proxies the calls to the API boundary nodes (though HTTP gateways are not decentralized)

To improve reliability and decentralization, the agent also supports dynamically routing API calls directly to globally distributed API boundary nodes. In particular, the agent is capable of:
- Automatically discovering and monitoring the list of all API boundary nodes.
- Filtering out unhealthy nodes.
- Dynamically routing API calls across healthy nodes using different built-in strategies (e.g., round-robin and latency-based routing).

Dynamic routing improves decentralization (by directly routing API calls to the decentralized API boundary nodes), resilience and performance (by dynamically adapting to the current state of the network).

On top of the built-in strategies, the agent allows developers to implement their custom routing strategies tailored to their specific use cases.

### Using dynamic routing

In the following, we show how you can instantiate an agent with the default dynamic routing using `ic0.app` as seed:

```rust
use ic_agent::Agent;
use url::Url;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Use the URL of an HTTP Gateway or API boundary node as the initial seed.
    let seed_url = Url::parse("https://ic0.app").unwrap();

    let agent = Agent::builder()
        .with_url(seed_url)
        .with_background_dynamic_routing()
        .build()
        .expect("failed to build ic-agent");

    // ... use agent for API calls
}
```

In this configuration, the agent distributes requests across multiple healthy API boundary nodes using a default weighted round-robin algorithm that favors lower-latency nodes, prioritizing those closer to the client.

#### Customizing dynamic routing

Dynamic routing in the agent is fully customizable, giving you the flexibility to customize the existing strategies or implement your own routing logic as needed. To instantiate the agent with a custom dynamic routing setup:

```rust
use std::{sync::Arc, time::Duration};

use ic_agent::{
    agent::route_provider::dynamic_routing::{
        dynamic_route_provider::{DynamicRouteProvider, DynamicRouteProviderBuilder},
        node::Node,
        snapshot::latency_based_routing::LatencyRoutingSnapshot,
    },
    Agent,
};
use reqwest::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Choose a routing strategy:
    // Use latency-based weighted round-robin with 3 lowest-latency nodes
    let routing_strategy = LatencyRoutingSnapshot::new().set_k_top_nodes(3);

    // Alternatively, use a basic round-robin routing across all healthy API nodes
    // let routing_strategy = RoundRobinRoutingSnapshot::new();

    // Or implement and provide your own custom routing strategy

    // Seed nodes used for initial topology discovery
    let seed_nodes = vec![
        Node::new("https://ic0.app").unwrap(),
        // optionally add existing API boundary nodes as seeds
        // Node::new("https://<api-boundary-node-domain>").unwrap(),
    ];

    let client = Client::builder()
        .build()
        .expect("failed to build HTTP client");

    let route_provider: DynamicRouteProvider<LatencyRoutingSnapshot> =
        DynamicRouteProviderBuilder::new(routing_strategy, seed_nodes, Arc::new(client))
            // Set how often to fetch the latest API boundary node topology
            .with_fetch_period(Duration::from_secs(10))
            // Set how often to perform health checks on the API boundary nodes
            .with_check_period(Duration::from_secs(2))
            // Or optionally provide a custom node health checker implementation
            // .with_checker(custom_checker)
            // Or optionally provide a custom topology fetcher implementation
            // .with_fetcher(custom_fetcher)
            .build()
            .await;

    let agent = Agent::builder()
        .with_arc_route_provider(Arc::new(route_provider))
        .build()
        .expect("failed to build ic-agent");

    // ... use the agent for making API calls
}
```
NOTE: To make use of custom dynamic routing, you must enable the currently internal feature by using:

```
cargo run --features _internal_dynamic-routing
```

##### How Dynamic Routing Works

At the core of dynamic routing in the agent is the `RouteProvider trait`, which dynamically selects a routing URL for each request by invoking its `route()` method:

```rust
pub trait RouteProvider {
    /// Generates the next routing URL based on the internal routing logic
    fn route(&self) -> Result<Url, AgentError>;
    /// Generates up to `n` different routing URLs in order of priority.
    fn n_ordered_routes(&self, n: usize) -> Result<Vec<Url>, AgentError>;
    ...
}
```

The example above instantiates `DynamicRouteProvider`, an implementation of `RouteProvider`, and injects it into the agent to handle dynamic request routing. 
The `DynamicRouteProvider` itself is generic and extensible, allowing you to define custom routing strategies. 

Two built-in strategies are available:
- Round-robin - distributes requests evenly across all healthy nodes
- Latency-based weighted round-robin - prioritizes healthy nodes with the lowest observed latency
In our example, we used the latency-based strategy to prioritize faster nodes, limiting the selection to the top three.

Under the hood, `DynamicRouteProvider` builds and maintains a dynamic routing table, which is continuously updated by running two background services:
- Discovery service - periodically fetches the latest API boundary node topology
- Health check service - periodically checks nodes health by pinging it
This design enables the agent to adapt to changes in node availability and network topology, resulting in a resilient and performant routing.

For more detailed information take a look at the [documentation]("https://TODO").

## Authentication

The Rust agent's `Identity` object provides signatures that can be used for HTTP requests or identity delegations. It represents the principal ID of the sender. `Identity` represents a single identity and cannot contain multiple identity values.

```rust
async fn create_a_canister() -> Result<Principal, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
  let agent = Agent::builder()
    .with_url(URL)
    .with_identity(create_identity())
    .build()?;
```

Identities can have different types, such as:

- `AnonymousIdentity`: A unit type used through `with_identity(AnonymousIdentity)`.

- `BasicIdentity`, `Secp256k1Identity`, and `Prime256v1Identity: Created from pre-existing keys through either function:
    - `BasicIdentity::from_pem_file("path/to/identity.pem")`
    - `BasicIdentity::from_key_pair(key_material)`

There are minor [variations in the function name](https://docs.rs/ic-agent/latest/ic_agent/identity/index.html).

- `ic-identity-hsm` crate: Used for hardware security modules (HSM) like Yubikey or Nitrokey through `HardwareIdentity::new(pkcs11_module_path, slot_index, key_id, || get_pin())`.

## Making calls

The Rust agent can be used to make calls to other canisters. To make a call to a canister, use the `agent.update` method for an update call or `agent.query` for a query call. Then, pass in the canister's ID and the canister's method you'd like to call.

The following example calls the ICP ledger and returns an account balance:

```rust
let icp_ledger = Principal::from_text("ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai").unwrap();
let response = agent.update(&icp_ledger, "account_balance")
    .with_arg(Encode!(&AccountBalanceArgs { account: some_account_id })?)
    .call_and_wait()
    .await?;
let tokens = Decode!(&response, Tokens)?;
```

## `ic-utils`

The [`ic-utils` crate](https://crates.io/crates/ic-utils) provides a high-level interface that is designed to be canister-oriented and aware of the canister's Candid interface. Canister objects with `ic-utils` resemble the following:

```rust
let canister = Canister::builder()
    .with_agent(&agent)
    .with_canister_id(principal)
    .build()?;
canister.query("account_balance")
    .with_arg(&AccountBalanceArg { user_id })
    .build()
    .await

```

`ic-utils` provides several interfaces, including the management canister, cycles wallet canister, and Bitcoin integration canister. For example, the management canister can be used with a call such as `ManagementCanister::create(&agent).canister_status(&canister_id).await`.

[Learn more in the ic-utils documentation](https://docs.rs/ic-utils/latest/ic_utils/).

## Response verification

When using the [certified queries](/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/advanced-calls/) feature, the agent must verify that the certificate returned with the query response is valid. A certificate consists of a tree, a signature on the tree's root hash that is valid under a public key, and an optional delegation linking the public key to the root public key. To validate the root hash, the agent uses the `HashTree` module.

Below is an example annotated with notes that explains how to verify responses using the `HashTree` module:

```rust
// Define a function that initializes the agent and builds a certified query call to get the XDR and ICP conversion rate from the cycles minter canister:
pub async fn xdr_permyriad_per_icp(agent: &Agent) -> DfxResult<u64> {
    let canister = Canister::builder()
        .with_agent(agent)
        .with_canister_id(MAINNET_CYCLE_MINTER_CANISTER_ID)
        .build()?;
    let (certified_rate,): (IcpXdrConversionRateCertifiedResponse,) = canister
        .query("get_icp_xdr_conversion_rate")
        .build()
        .call()
        .await?;
    // Check the certificate with a query call
    let cert = serde_cbor::from_slice(&certified_rate.certificate)?;
    agent
        .verify(&cert, MAINNET_CYCLE_MINTER_CANISTER_ID)
        .context(
            "The origin of the certificate for the XDR <> ICP exchange rate could not be verified",
        )?;
    // Verify that the certificate can be trusted:
    let witness = lookup_value(
        &cert,
        [
            b"canister",
            MAINNET_CYCLE_MINTER_CANISTER_ID.as_slice(),
            b"certified_data",
        ],
    )
    .context("The IC's certificate for the XDR <> ICP exchange rate could not be verified")?;
    // Call the HashTree for the certified_rate call:
    let tree = serde_cbor::from_slice::<HashTree<Vec<u8>>>(&certified_rate.hash_tree)?;
    ensure!(
        tree.digest() == witness,
        "The CMC's certificate for the XDR <> ICP exchange rate did not match the IC's certificate"
    );
    // Verify that the HashTree can be trusted:
    let lookup = tree.lookup_path([b"ICP_XDR_CONVERSION_RATE"]);
    let certified_data = if let LookupResult::Found(content) = lookup {
        content
    } else {
        bail!("The CMC's certificate did not contain the XDR <> ICP exchange rate");
    };
    let encoded_data = Encode!(&certified_rate.data)?;
    ensure!(
        certified_data == encoded_data,
        "The CMC's certificate for the XDR <> ICP exchange rate did not match the provided rate"
    );
    // If the above checks are successful, you can trust the exchange rate that has been returned:
    Ok(certified_rate.data.xdr_permyriad_per_icp)
}
```

Another application of `HashTree` can be found in the [ic-certified-assets](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/canisters/frontend/ic-certified-assets/src/asset_certification/tree.rs) code.

## Example

The following is an example of how to use the agent interface to make a call to a canister (in this example, the ICP ledger) deployed on the mainnet:

```rust
use ic_agent::{Agent, export::Principal};
use candid::{Encode, Decode, CandidType, Nat};
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(CandidType)]
struct AccountBalanceArgs {
    account: Vec<u8>,
}
#[derive(CandidType, Deserialize)]
struct Tokens {
    e8s: u64,
}
let icp_ledger = Principal::from_text("ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai").unwrap();
let response = agent.update(&icp_ledger, "account_balance")
    .with_arg(Encode!(&AccountBalanceArgs { account: some_account_id })?)
    .call_and_wait()
    .await?;
let tokens = Decode!(&response, Tokens)?;
```
