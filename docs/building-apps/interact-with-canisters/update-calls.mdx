# Update calls

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

To interact with a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>'s methods, there are two primary types of calls that can be used: update calls and query calls.

**Update calls** can make modifications to a canister's state, while **query calls** cannot. Update calls are executed on all nodes of the <GlossaryTooltip>subnet</GlossaryTooltip> that the canister is deployed on since the result of the call must go through [consensus](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34207558615956-Consensus). This makes them slower than query calls. They can be synchronous or asynchronous.

:::danger
Update calls do not go through consensus on the local development environment.
:::

A query method can be called as both an update or a query, whereas update methods can only be called as an update.

| Update calls | Query calls |
| :----------: | :------: |
| Slow (1-2s) | Fast (200-400ms) |
| Can modify state | Can't modify state |
| Goes through consensus | Does not go through consensus |
| Executed on all nodes of a [subnet](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34209955782420-Subnet-Creation) | Executed on a single node |
| Cost cycles | Free |

## Making update calls with `dfx`

To make an update call to a canister, use the [`dfx canister call`](/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-call) command with the `--update` flag:

- `dfx canister call --update <canister-name> <method_name>` : Make an update call to a canister deployed locally. The local development environment must be running to deploy and call a canister locally. Start it with `dfx start --background`.

- `dfx canister call --update <canister-name> <method_name> --network=playground`: Make an update call to a canister deployed on the [playground](/building-apps/developing-canisters/deploy#testnets). Making update calls to canisters deployed on the playground is free, but canisters are temporary and will be removed after 20 minutes.

- `dfx canister call --update <canister-name> <method_name> --network=ic`: Make an update call to a canister deployed on the mainnet. Update calls will cost [cycles](/building-apps/essentials/gas-cost).
