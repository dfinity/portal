# Canister benchmarking

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate"]} />

Canisters deployed on ICP use resources such as memory and compute. Resources are finite, and there are limits configured that restrict how many resources a canister may consume. The `canbench` Rust crate provides a way to benchmark a canister's resources so developers can gain an insight into how their canister uses memory, instructions, and other resources.

`canbench` can be used to provide information such as:

- Insight into how a canister consumes stable memory, heap memory, and instructions.

- Detecting possible performance regressions, both locally or on the mainnet.

- Analyzing performance bottlenecks.

Features of `canbench` include:

- Supports benchmarks that are up to 10 trillion instructions.

- Reports the number of instructions consumed alongside changes to stable and heap memories.

- Persistence of benchmarking results in your canister's repo.

- Language agnostic, though initially only support for Rust exists.

## Installation

You can install `canbench` using [cargo](https://crates.io/).

```bash
cargo install canbench
```

Add an optional dependency for `canbench` in your `Cargo.toml` file:

``` title="Cargo.toml"
canbench-rs = { version = "0.1.1", optional = true }
```

Then, edit the `canbench.yml` file to point to your canister's Wasm file:

```yml title="canbench.yml"
build_cmd:
  cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --features canbench-rs

wasm_path:
  ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<YOUR_CANISTER>.wasm
```

## Example benchmark test

Below is an example canister that uses a `query` function to compute and return the fibonacci sequence of a given number:

```rust title="src/example_backend/src/lib.rs"
#[ic_cdk::query]
fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if n == 0 {
        return 0;
    } else if n == 1 {
        return 1;
    }

    let mut a = 0;
    let mut b = 1;
    let mut result = 0;

    for _ in 2..=n {
        result = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = result;
    }

    result
}
```

An example benchmark test using `canbench` for this canister could look like this:

```
#[cfg(feature = "canbench-rs")]
mod benches {
    use super::*;
    use canbench_rs::bench;


    #[bench]
    fn fibonacci_20() {
        // NOTE: the result is printed to prevent the compiler from optimizing the call away.
        println!("{:?}", fibonacci(20));
    }
}
```

The benchmark output of this test would resemble the following:

```
canbench

---------------------------------------------------

Benchmark: fibonacci_20 (new)
  total:
    instructions: 2301 (new)
    heap_increase: 0 pages (new)
    stable_memory_increase: 0 pages (new)

---------------------------------------------------

Executed 1 of 1 benchmarks.
```
