# Using third-party canisters

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

Third-party canisters are canisters created by DFINITY or ICP community members that provide an important functionality that other developers may want to integrate within their own projects. It is important to test integrations with these canisters locally to:

- Validate the accuracy of the integration and other canister code.
- Test without paying <GlossaryTooltip>cycles</GlossaryTooltip>.
- Use non-production data and environments.
- Execute operations faster when run locally.

To integrate with third-party canisters and test them within your project, you can either:

- If the canister's Candid and Wasm files are publicly available, the URLs of the files can be referenced directly in the project's `dfx.json` file.

- If the canister is configured as `pullable`, it can be pulled into a project with `dfx deps`.

## Using a canister's Candid and Wasm files directly

If a canister's Candid and Wasm files are publicly available, you can reference them directly in a project's `dfx.json` file.

If the canister is deployed to the mainnet, you can also specify the `remote` canister ID. When your project is deployed to the mainnet, it will use the mainnet canister with that ID. When your project is deployed locally, `dfx` will download the specified Candid and Wasm files and create a new local canister using them.

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "icp_ledger_canister": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9/rs/ledger_suite/icp/ledger.did",
      "wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9/canisters/ledger-canister.wasm.gz",
      "remote": {
        "id": {
          "ic": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
        }
      },
...
```

Alternatively, you can reference Candid and Wasm files stored in your local environment:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "icp_ledger_canister": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "ledger.did",
      "wasm": "ledger-canister.wasm.gz",
      "remote": {
        "id": {
          "ic": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
        }
      },
...
```

An example of using this method is the [XRC demo project.](https://github.com/THLO/xrc_demo/blob/main/dfx.json#L15)

## Using `dfx deps` to pull third-party canisters

The command and workflow can be used to pull third-party canisters into a project that is deployed locally or on the mainnet.

In this workflow, a **service provider** configures a canister to be `pullable` and then deploys the canister to the mainnet. A service provider can be anyone, such as a community developer creating a public, third-party canister.

Then a **service consumer** can pull the canister as a dependency directly from the mainnet using [`dfx deps`](/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-deps) and deploy the dependency locally.

### Determining if a canister should be `pullable`

First the canister must be configured to be `pullable`. Developers must ask the question of whether the canister *should* be `pullable`. Canisters should be `pullable` if it provides a public service at a static canister ID. If it depends on other canisters, those dependencies should also be `pullable`.

### Configuring a canister to be `pullable`

A service provider must configure a canister to be `pullable` by setting the following configuration details in the project's `dfx.json` file:

- `wasm_url`: A URL used to download the canister Wasm module, which will be deployed locally.
- `wasm_hash`: A SHA256 hash of the Wasm module located at `wasm_url`. This field is optional. In most cases, the Wasm module at `wasm_url` will be the same as the onchain Wasm module. This means that `dfx` can read the state tree to obtain and verify the module hash. In some cases, the Wasm module at `wasm_url` is not the same as the onchain Wasm module. For example, the Internet Identity canister provides a `development` variant to be integrated locally. In these cases, `wasm_hash` provides the expected hash, and `dfx` verifies the downloaded Wasm against this.

If the `wasm_hash` of the Wasm module at `wasm_url` does not match, `dfx` will abort with an error message indicating that there is a hash mismatch. In this scenario, the service consumer should contact the service provider. It is the responsibility of the service provider to assure that the correct Wasm module can be downloaded from the `wasm_url`.

- `dependencies`: An array of canister IDs (`Principal`) of direct dependencies.
- `init_guide`: A message to guide consumers on how to initialize the canister.


```json
{
    "canisters": {
        "service": {
            "type": "motoko",
            "main": "src/main.mo",
            "pullable": {
                "wasm_url": "http://example.com/a.wasm",
                "wasm_hash": "d180f1e232bafcee7d4879d8a2260ee7bcf9a20c241468d0e9cf4aa15ef8f312",
                "dependencies": [
                    "yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai"
                ],
                "init_guide": "A natural number, e.g. 10."
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::danger
The Wasm module of a `pullable` canister must be hosted via a public URL where service consumers can download it, such as GitHub.
:::

The `pullable` object will be serialized as a part of the `dfx` metadata and attached to the Wasm.

### Canister metadata requirements

A third-party canister used in production should have public `dfx` metadata and public or private `candid:service` and `candid:args` metadata. All metadata sections are handled by `dfx` when the canister is built.

### Deployment process

Service providers should use the following deployment process to deploy their `pullable` canister and make it available to others:

- #### Step 1: Deploy the canister to the mainnet.

```
dfx deploy <canister-name> --network ic
```

- #### Step 2: If you're using GitHub, [`git tag` and `GitHub release`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release) with the commands:

```
git tag 0.1.0
git push --tags
```

- #### Step 3: Attach the Wasm to the release assets.

Edit the GitHub release and attach the deployed Wasm as a release asset. The deployed Wasm file will be located at:

```
.dfx/ic/canisters/<CANISTER_NAME>/<CANISTER_NAME>.wasm
```

### Automating the service provider process in CI

An [example CI configuration](https://github.com/lwshang/pullable/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) demonstrates how to use a GitHub Action to automate the deploy routine described above.

The workflow with CI will follow these steps:

1. Push a git tag and wait for the GitHub release to complete.
2. Download the canister Wasm from the release assets (`wget https://github.com/lwshang/pullable/releases/latest/download/service.wasm`).
3. Install (upgrade) the canister using the downloaded Wasm (`dfx canister --network ic install service --wasm service.wasm --argument '(1 : nat)' --mode upgrade`).

### Pulling a third-party canister into your project

The following workflow can be used for consumers to import a `pullable` canister as a dependency.

- #### Step 1: Declare "pull" dependencies in `dfx.json`.

An example `dfx.json` in which the consumer is developing a canister named "dapp" that has two pull dependencies can be found below:

- "dep_b" has a canister ID of `yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai` on the mainnet.
- "dep_c" has a canister ID of `yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai` on the mainnet.

```json
{
    "canisters": {
        "dapp": {
            "type": "motoko",
            "main": "src/main.mo",
            "dependencies": [
                "dep_b", "dep_c"
            ]
        },
        "dep_b": {
            "type": "pull",
            "id": "yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai"
        },
        "dep_c": {
            "type": "pull",
            "id": "yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai"
        }
    }
}
```

- #### Step 2: Pull the dependencies using the `dfx deps pull` command.

`dfx deps pull` connects to the mainnet by default (`--network ic`). You can choose other networks as usual, e.g., `--network local`.

- #### Step 3: Set init arguments using `dfx deps init`.

Running the command `dfx deps init` will iterate over all dependencies in the `pulled.json` file and set an empty argument for any that do not need an `init` argument. Then, it will print the list of dependencies that do require an `init` argument.

Running the command `dfx deps init <CANISTER> --argument <ARGUMENT>` will set the `init` argument for an individual dependency. The init arguments will be recorded in `deps/init.json`.

To set the init arguments:

```
dfx deps init
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
WARN: The following canister(s) require an init argument. Please run `dfx deps init <NAME/PRINCIPAL>` to set them individually:
yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai
yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai (dep_c)
```

</details>

If you try to set an `init` argument for an individual dependency without an argument, it will result in the following error:

```
Error: Canister yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai requires an init argument. The following info might be helpful:
init_guide => A natural number, e.g., 10.
candid:args => (nat)
```

To set an init argument with an argument using the `--argument` flag:

```
dfx deps init <canister-id> --argument 10
dfx deps init deps_c --argument 20
```

The resulting generated file `init.json` will have the following content:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai": {
      "arg_str": "10",
      "arg_raw": "4449444c00017d0a"
    },
    "yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai": {
      "arg_str": null,
      "arg_raw": null
    },
    "yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai": {
      "arg_str": "20",
      "arg_raw": "4449444c00017d14"
    }
  }
}
```

- #### Step 4: Deploy the pulled dependencies in your local environment using the `dfx deps deploy` command.

```
dfx deps deploy
```

Running the `dfx deps deploy` command will:

1. Create the dependencies in your local environment with the same mainnet canister ID.
2. Then, it will install the downloaded Wasm with the init arguments in the `init.json` file.

You can also specify the canister name or <GlossaryTooltip>principal</GlossaryTooltip> to deploy one particular dependency.

`dfx deps deploy` always creates the canister with the anonymous identity so that dependencies and application canisters will have different controllers. It will also always install the canister in "reinstall" mode so that the canister status will be discarded.

### Frequently asked questions

- #### Why download the Wasm into shared cache instead of a project subfolder?

It is not encouraged to include binary files in version control. On the [Internet Computer](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/33152818663444-What-is-ICP), every canister only has one latest version running on the mainnet. Service consumers should integrate with that latest version.

`dfx deps pull` always gets the latest dependencies instead of locking on a particular run. Every pulled canister has the latest version in the shared cache and can be reused by different projects.

- #### Should I include the `deps/` folder in version control?

Yes. `deps/` files enable the dependent canister to build and get IDE support. If the required Wasm files are also available in the shared cache, all applications and dependencies can be deployed and tested integrally.

Considering a canister developer team:

1.  Developer 1 follows the [service consumer workflow](#service-consumer-workflow) and includes all generated `deps/` files in source control.
2.  Developer 2 pulls the branch by Developer 1 and runs the `dfx deps pull` command again.
    - If the `pulled.json` has no change, then all dependencies are still up to date. Developer 2 can run `dfx deps deploy` without setting init arguments again.
    - If there are changes in `pulled.json`, Developer 2 can try to run `dfx deps deploy` to see if all init arguments are still valid. Then Developer 2 can run `dfx deps init` if necessary and update source control.

These files also help CI to detect outdated dependencies.
