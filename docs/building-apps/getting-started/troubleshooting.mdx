# IC SDK troubleshooting

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner"]} />

This section provides information to help you troubleshoot and resolve or work around common issues that are related to the following tasks:

- Downloading and installing the IC SDK.

- Creating, building, or deploying canisters.

- Using the [IC SDK](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install).

- Running the local replica.

## Migrating an existing project

Currently, there is no automatic migration or backward compatibility for any projects that you might have created using previous versions of the IC SDK. After upgrading to the latest version, you might see error or failure messages if you attempt to build or install a project created with a previous version of the IC SDK.

In many cases, however, you can continue to work with projects from a previous release by manually changing the `dfx` setting in the `dfx.json` configuration file, then rebuilding the project to be compatible with the version of the IC SDK you have currently installed.

For example, if you have a project that was created with IC SDK version `0.8.0`, open the `dfx.json` file in a text editor and change the `dfx` setting to the latest version or remove the section entirely.

## Restarting the local replica

In some cases, starting the local replica fails due to stale state. If you encounter issues when running `dfx start` to start the local replica:

- #### Step 1: Interrupt the local replica process through Ctrl+C if necessary, then stop the local replica:

```bash
dfx stop
```

- #### Step 2: If not all `dfx` processes can be stopped, forcibly end them:

```
dfx killall
```

- #### Step 3: Restart the local replica in a clean state by running the following command:

```bash
dfx start --clean --background
```

The `--clean` option removes checkpoints and stale state information from your project’s cache so that you can restart the local replica and web server processes in a clean state.

:::danger
Resetting the state information by running `dfx start --clean` removes your existing canisters, and new canister IDs may differ from old ones.
:::

- #### Step 4: Recreate your canisters:

```bash
dfx canister create --all
dfx build
dfx canister install --all
```

## Removing the canisters directory

If you run into problems building or deploying canisters after successfully connecting to ICP and registering canister identifiers, you should remove the `canisters` directory before attempting to rebuild or redeploy the canisters.

You can remove the `canisters` directory for a project by running the following command in the project’s root directory:

```bash
rm -rf ./.dfx/* canisters/*
```

## Reinstalling `dfx`

Some bugs can be addressed by uninstalling and reinstalling the IC SDK:

```bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

If you have modified the location of the IC SDK binary (the binary is titled `dfx`), you might want to run the following command to uninstall the version of the IC SDK that is in your PATH, then reinstall the latest version of the IC SDK:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/dfinity && rm $(which dfx) && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

## Xcode prerequisite

For macOS environments, you should have **Developer Command Line Tools** installed if you want to create a Git repository for your project.

You can check whether you have the developer tools installed by running `xcode-select -p`. You can install the developer tools by running `xcode-select --install`.

## Memory leak

Fixing memory leaks is an ongoing process. If you encounter any error messages related to memory leaks, you should do the following:

- #### Step 1: Run `dfx stop` to stop currently running processes.

- #### Step 2: Uninstall the IC SDK to prevent further degradation.

- #### Step 3: Reinstall the IC SDK

- #### Step 4: Run `dfx start` to restart replica processes.

Alternatively, you can remove the `.cache/dfinity` directory and reinstall the latest IC SDK `dfx` binary:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/dfinity && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```
