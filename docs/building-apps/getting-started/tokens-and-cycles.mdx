# Tokens & cycles

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Getting started"]} />

For ICP developers, there are two important tokens:

1. The **ICP token** is the protocol’s native utility token, which can be purchased and traded on various exchanges. It plays a key role in the [governance](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34574082263700-Tokenomics-Governance) and economics of the network.

2. **Cycles** are used to pay for resource and service consumption, comparable to gas on Ethereum. The price of cycles is pegged to [XDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights), a group of fiat currencies, where **1 trillion (T) cycles equals 1 XDR** (1 XDR is around 1.3 USD as of early 2025).

ICP tokens can be converted to cycles, which are then used to cover the cost of running an application.

Note, ICP supports creating and deploying custom fungible or non-fungible tokens through the [ICRC standards](/docs/defi/token-standards/).

## Canister resource consumption

Canisters require resources like storage, compute, and network bandwidth. When a canister is deployed to the mainnet, it utilizes the resources provided by the network's nodes. Canisters are charged for the resources they use, calls they send, and any operations they perform using specialized features such as HTTPS outcalls, threshold signatures, and the Bitcoin integration API. Each type of canister operation and resource has a different cost associated with it, and costs linearly scale with the number of nodes in the [subnet](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34209955782420-Subnet-Creation).

A canister pays for consumed resources by burning cycles. It's the developer's responsibility to load each of their canisters with adequate amounts of cycles, though anyone can send cycles to any canister. This cost model is known as ICP's **reverse gas model**.

### Local and playground deployments

Canisters deployed locally are limited to the resources provided by your local machine. Local deployments use fabricated cycles generated by `dfx`.

Canisters deployed with the playground option ([see quickstart](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/quickstart)), are deployed to a pool of DFINITY-managed canisters that are recycled every 20 minutes. Similar to a testnet, this allows developers to quickly deploy their first canister smart contract without needing to acquire ICP tokens and convert them to cycles. Since deploying to the playground is free, there are limitations on the resources that can be used and the features that are available to canisters.

## What is a ledger?

A [**ledger**](/docs/defi/overview) is a system canister that stores token balances and transactions for a set of accounts. Each token has its own ledger, such as the ICP token ledger and the cycles ledger.

[Learn more about ledgers](/docs/defi/overview).

## Obtaining cycles

You need to obtain [ICP tokens](https://internetcomputer.org/icp-tokens), then convert them into cycles using `dfx`. However, when participating at DFINITY events like [hackathons](https://dfinity.org/hackathons), you can receive a coupon that you can redeem to claim free cycles from the [cycles faucet](https://anv4y-qiaaa-aaaal-qaqxq-cai.ic0.app/).

Before obtaining cycles, you need a [developer identity](identities.mdx). Each developer identity has a principal and a ledger account identifier.

A principal has the format `itk7v-ihlxk-ktdrh-fcnst-vkoou-orj77-52ogl-jqwj5-zpfdv-az3lr-xqe` and is used for canister ownership, management, and holding cycles.

A ledger account identifier has the format `e213184a548871a47fb526f3cba24e2ee2fbbc8129c4ab497ef2ce535130a0a4` and is used to send and receive tokens like ICP.

### Step 1: Get your account's ledger account ID.

```
dfx ledger account-id
```

```
b0d7beee54be8679a42e999218a16a0d396f223d7e44d259ac089848c1b820bf
```

</details>

### Step 2: Send ICP tokens to this ledger account ID.

You can obtain [ICP tokens](https://internetcomputer.org/icp-tokens) from an [exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/markets). If you are using an exchange, initiate a withdrawal transaction, then enter the ledger account ID as the "destination" address to send ICP tokens to.

### Step 3: Check the ICP balance.

```
dfx ledger balance --network=ic
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
2.00000000 ICP
```

</details>

### Step 4: Convert ICP into cycles.

Because resource consumption is accounted for at a fine-grained level, a single cycle corresponds to a very small amount of money. As a result, developers deal with large amounts of cycles when topping up their canisters, usually operating with trillions (T) of cycles. Since cycles are pegged to XDR, 1 T cycles will remain stable at about 1.3 USD.

Replace `AMOUNT` with the number of ICP tokens you want to convert into cycles:

```
dfx cycles convert --amount AMOUNT --network=ic
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
Transfer sent at block height 16146446
Using transfer at block height 16146446
Account was topped up with 6_229_700_000_000 cycles! New balance is 6_229_600_000_000 cycles.
```

</details>

This command must be run with the `--network=ic` flag because cycles are fabricated during local development.


### Calculating how many cycles you need

Cycles are charged for storage, compute, update messages, special features, and more. To get an approximation, you can view the [detailed cycles cost table](/docs/building-apps/essentials/gas-cost) or use the [cycles pricing calculator](/docs/building-apps/essentials/gas-cost).

### Step 5: Confirm the cycles balance.

```
dfx cycles balance --network=ic
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
6.230 TC (trillion cycles).
```
