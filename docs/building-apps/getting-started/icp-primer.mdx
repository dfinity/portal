# ICP primer

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Getting started"]} />

The ICP network is made up of **nodes** that each run software known as the **replica**. The replica provides the execution environment for running canisters. A group of interconnected nodes is known as a **subnet**. Subnets vary in size between 13 and 40 nodes.

Canisters can be deployed to the mainnet, the playground, or the local replica. When a canister is deployed to the mainnet or the playground, it is deployed to a subnet and replicated across all nodes on that subnet, meaning there are multiple instances of the canister running at once in parallel. Canisters are replicated for security, reliability, redundancy, and state consistency. A canister on one subnet can communicate with canisters on another subnet.

Canisters deployed to the local replica are not replicated.

## Canister resource consumption

Canisters require resources like storage, compute, and network bandwidth. When a canister is deployed to the mainnet and running on a subnet, it utilizes the resources provided by that subnet's nodes. Canisters are charged for the resources they use, calls they send, and any operations they perform using features such as HTTPS outcalls, threshold signatures, and the Bitcoin integration API. Each type of canister operation and resource has a different cost associated with it, and costs linearly scale with the number of nodes in the subnet.

A canister pays for resources by burning **cycles**. It's the developer's responsibility to load each of their canisters with adequate cycles, though anyone can send cycles to any canister. This cost model is known as ICP's **reverse gas model**. Developers can obtain cycles by [converting ICP tokens](tokens-and-cycles.mdx) into cycles using `dfx`.

Locally deployed canisters are limited to the resources provided by the local machine and cycles are fabricated for development purposes.

## Canister calls

After you deploy a canister, it can begin receiving and processing requests from users and from other canisters. Canisters that are available to send requests and receive replies are considered in be in a `Running` state.

A canister's state can be read or modified through the use of query or update calls respectively. Query calls do not go through consensus and do not alter the canister's state, while update calls do go through consensus and can modify canister state. A canister answers the calls it receives in a first-in first-out manner.

Canisters can also make calls to the [management canister](/docs/references/system-canisters/management-canister), which acts as the network's system API used to access features of ICP such as randomness and timers.

## Canister modifications

A canister's code is mutable. It can be upgraded to apply code changes or reinstalled with an entirely new Wasm module. Changes to the canister, such as upgrades or modifications to the canister's settings, can be executed by the canister's **controllers**. A controller is a [developer identity](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/identities) or another canister that has permission to make such changes.

In the initial stages of development, the canister is usually controlled by its developer, which allows the developer to iterate quickly. As the canister becomes mature and production ready, the control over it could move to a decentralized organization (such as an SNS) to make the canister more secure and trustworthy.
