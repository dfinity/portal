# SNS initial parameters {#setting-parameters}

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />


Typically, one would first decide on tokenomics and other configurations, for example, using the [SNS tokenomics training & tools](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_SNS_tokenomics_configuration) as described in [this section](./tokenomics-intro.mdx).
After deciding on these configurations, the next step is to translate them into initial parameters that the SNS will be initialized as the [first step of the SNS launch process](../launching/launch-steps-1proposal.mdx).

This section explains, on a technical but high level, how initial parameters are set and how they affect different canisters.
The [SNS CLI tool](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/sns/cli) allows you to set these parameters and includes detailed descriptions of all parameters.

### Initial parameters
All SNS parameters are set in a **.yaml** file that can then be passed as an argument to the NNS proposal that triggers the SNS launch, both for testing and in production.
To make sure that all parameters make sense and are also consistent with each other, it is recommended to test the proposal locally.

**To create the SNS parameter YAML file, copy the [template file](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing/blob/main/example_sns_init.yaml) and fill in the fields with the desired values.** Note that this file is just an example, and all of the values were chosen somewhat arbitrarily, so they should be adjusted to the specific desires of the SNS and not taken as official recommendations.

These are the categories of parameters that can be set:
- **Parameters of the SNS governance canister**: These are parameters of the governance that can, in contrast to the other parameters listed here, be changed later by SNS proposals. They include parameters such as the minimum stake that a neuron must have or the cost (in the native SNS governance token) of submitting a proposal that is rejected.

- **Configurations in the SNS ledger canister:** This includes configurations of the SNS ledger canister, such as the token name, token symbol, and the ledger transaction fee.

- **The initial token distribution**: this allows specifying which portion of tokens are allocated to whom. Tokens can be distributed to the following buckets:
   - **Developer tokens** that are appointed to the original developers of the dapp and seed funders.
   - **Treasury tokens** that are owned by the SNS governance canister, which can be spent by the SNS community according to their needs.
   - **Swap tokens** that are owned by the SNS swapped in exchange for ICP tokens in the decentralization swap. If the swap is successful, the participants will receive SNS tokens in a basket of neurons.
- **Decentralization swap parameters**: This defines the parameters of the decentralization swap:
  - **Rules of the swap** such as the minimum number of ICP tokens that the swap must collect to be successful and the maximum number of ICP tokens that it will collect.
  - **Conditions of swap participation**, such as the definition of a text that must be confirmed by users when participating in the swap and the possibility to define countries from which users cannot participate (by IP addresses).

- **Fallback controllers of the dapp**: If a decentralization swap fails, for example, because the targeted minimum number of ICP tokens could not be collected, the control of the dapp canister(s) is handed back to the principals defined in these parameters. Normally, this will be set to principals owned by the developers that controlled the dapp before the attempt to decentralize it.

All developer and airdrop tokens are distributed to neurons.
They are called **developer neurons** and **airdrop neurons**, respectively, and refer to all these neurons as the **initial neurons**.

:::caution

The developer and airdrop neurons are the only neurons that exist when the dapp's control is handed over to the SNS and during the decentralization swap.
At this point, the dapp canister(s) are already controlled by the SNS.
Even though the governance canister is in a special pre-decentralization mode, some proposals can already be used, for example, to upgrade the dapp canister(s) or to register new kinds of proposals.
Therefore, **if you want to use SNS proposals at this stage, for example, to ensure that the dapp can be upgraded at any time, you must make sure that enough of the initial neurons can vote to reach a decision.**
See [stage 1 of the launch](../launching/launch-summary-1proposal.mdx) for more details of this.
:::

All initial contributors (developers, seed funders, etc.) and the swap participants receive their neurons as a *basket of neurons*.
This means that rather than one neuron, they can get many neurons with different dissolve delays. The details of these neurons can be set in the initialization.
