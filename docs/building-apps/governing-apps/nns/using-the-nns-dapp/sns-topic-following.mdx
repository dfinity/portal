# SNS - delegate voting power to other neurons

As with the NNS, you can delegate your voting power in the SNS DAOs by following other neurons. 
The same following rules as in the NNS are applied (see here).

Before April 2025, SNS vote delegation was based on each individual proposal type. Now, vote delegation is done on a per-topic basis - similar to the NNS. Before users set the delegations based on topics for the first time, their old _legacy_ following is still applied and visible in the NNS dapp. 

This tutorial describes how you can delegate your voting power based on topics and what this means for your legacy delegations.
