# Advanced neuron operations

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Governance", "Tutorial"]} />

Once you're more familiar with the NNS, you might want to explore additional
neuron operations using the NNS dapp.

For more background on neurons—including voting rewards and detailed
explanations of available operations—refer to the
[Neurons overview](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34084120668692-NNS-Neurons).

## Maturity Disbursement

As you vote on proposals (either directly or by following other neurons), your
neuron's maturity increases. This maturity represents your accumulated
governance rewards.

When the locked maturity reaches a **minimum threshold of 1.05 ICP**, you can
disburse it. This operation burns the maturity and schedules the minting of new
ICP tokens. After 7 days, the newly minted ICP will be sent to the selected
destination address.

> **Note:** For Ledger devices, [Spawn Neuron](#spawn-new-neurons) is available.
> Support for **Disburse Maturity** will be added later.

### Disburse Maturity

- #### Step 1: In the [staking page](https://nns.ic0.app/neurons/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai) of the NNS dapp, navigate to the neuron whose maturity you want to disburse. Click **Disburse** in the **Maturity** section.

- #### Step 2: In the form that opens, select both the percentage of maturity to disburse and the destination account.

You can choose one of your associated accounts or enter any NNS account
identifier manually. Manual input is available either as plain text or via QR
code (found by clicking the **Receive** button on the wallet page).

You can copy the account identifier from any wallet page.

- #### Step 3: After clicking **Disburse**, you'll be taken to an overview step where you can review and confirm the disbursement parameters.

- #### Step 4: When a disbursement is in progress, a **View Active Disbursements** button appears in the **Maturity** section.

This opens the **Active Disbursements** modal, which shows all disbursements in
progress—including their start time, destination address, and the amount of
maturity being disbursed.

## Spawn New Neurons

### Spawn your voting rewards into a new neuron

The spawn operation creates a new neuron by locking a new balance of ICP on the
ledger.

For example, if you have a neuron with 100 ICP and 10% maturity, spawning will
create a new neuron with approximately 10 ICP. To meet the threshold for
spawning, maturity must exceed **1%** of the staked amount.

After spawning, the original neuron's maturity resets to zero.

### How to spawn a new neuron

- #### Step 1:

In the NNS dapp, open the **Neuron Staking** section, then select the neuron
that has reached the required maturity.

- #### Step 2:
  Click **Spawn Neuron**, then follow the prompts to complete the process.
