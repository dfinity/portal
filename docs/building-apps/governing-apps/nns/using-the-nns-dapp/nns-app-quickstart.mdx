There are different ways to interact with the NNS DAO to participate in governance.

This guide will demonstrate how to interface with the NNS through the [NNS dapp](https://nns.ic0.app).
You can interact with the NNS through other tools, such as [quill](https://github.com/dfinity/quill)
and [ic-js](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/nns).

This section starts with a tutorial on how to connect and log in to the NNS dapp.
In the following pages, you will see how to use the NNS dapp to
[transfer tokens](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/nns/using-the-nns-dapp/nns-dapp-send-and-receive-tokens),
[stake tokens and set up a neuron](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/nns/using-the-nns-dapp/nns-dapp-staking-a-neuron),
and how to participate in voting either by [voting manually](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/nns/using-the-nns-dapp/nns-dapp-voting-on-proposals)
 or by [following other neurons](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/nns/using-the-nns-dapp/nns-dapp-following-other-neurons).

- #### Step 2:  Click **Login** to connect to [Internet Identity](https://identity.internetcomputer.org/).

![Connect with Internet Identity](../../_attachments/nns2.png)

If you haven’t previously registered, you can click **Register with Internet Identity** to register.

:::info
We strongly recommend you add multiple devices and authentication methods to your Internet Identity. For example, register multiple physical devices like your computer and phone with a security key and using the authentication options that those devices—and browsers running on them—support.
:::

For more information about creating an Internet Identity, see [how to use Internet Identity](https://internetidentity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15430677359124-How-Do-I-Create-an-Internet-Identity-on-My-Mobile-Device-).

After you have registered, you can click **Login** to authenticate using your anchor and the authentication method—for example, a security key or fingerprint—you have registered.

- #### Step 3:  Click **Proceed** to access to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp.

## Add an account

Logging on using an Internet Identity creates a main account for you in the Internet Computer ledger. If your ICP utility tokens are associated with your developer identity; that is, the identity created by the SDK `dfx` command-line interface. Your main account displays 0.00 for your ICP utility token balance. For example:

![nns app main](../../_attachments/nns3.png)

Before transferring any tokens, you can create one or more linked subaccounts or attach a hardware wallet to your account.

To add an account for managing ICP utility tokens:

- #### Step 1:  On the default 'Tokens' tab, click 'ICP', then **Add Account**.

![Add account](../../_attachments/nns4.png)

- #### Step 2:  Select the type of account to add.

    -   **New Account** creates a new subaccount linked to your Main account address in the ledger.

    -   **New Account (Hardware Wallet)** adds a hardware wallet to your main account address in the ledger.
