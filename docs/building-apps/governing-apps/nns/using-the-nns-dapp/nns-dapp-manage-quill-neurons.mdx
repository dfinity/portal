You may have neurons controlled by a principal ID that was created using [quill](https://github.com/dfinity/quill/). In this case, it may be inconvenient to manage your neurons through the terminal. If you know the seed phrase of this principal ID, you can use a Ledger hardware wallet to manage your neurons through the [NNS dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/).

## How to access neurons controlled by a principal ID created with quill

To follow this process, you may want to set up a new Ledger device. If you do, skip **step 1** and **step 2**. See warning message below for more information.

- **Step 1**: Unlock your Ledger device and navigate to **Settings Manage device** > **Security** > **Reset device**

- **Step 2**: Type in your PIN to reset your Ledger device.

**Warning**: This process will reset the private key of your Ledger device. **You will no longer have access to digital assets you hold on this device.**

While you can always regain access by resetting the device with its current seed phrase, you may want to use a new Ledger device to continue. In general, it is advised to securely store your seed phrase.

- **Step 3**: After your Ledger device has been successfully reset, navigate to **Restore from Recovery phrase**.

- **Step 12**: Click **Add to NNS Dapp** to add your NNS Dapp principal ID as a hotkey to the neurons. This allows you to see and manage your neurons using the NNS Dapp. For all actions outside of voting and changing following, you will need to have your Ledger device connected and approve the action.
