# Voting

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Governance", "Concept"]} />


The NNS DAO is an open governance system where anyone can become a participant by [staking some ICP in a neuron](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/nns/overview#stake-icp-utility-tokens-in-a-neuron). At least 1 ICP is required to create a neuron.

Locking tokens for a period of time is known as the neuron's dissolve delay. If a neuron has more than 6 months dissolve delay, it is eligible to participate in voting. This means that it can both submit and vote on proposals.


## Finding proposals and discussions

You can see all the NNS proposals on the [Internet Computer dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance) or on the [NNS dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/). Voters can freely discuss proposals anywhere they like. Many NNS proposals are discussed on the [developer forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/c/roadmap/29).

## Direct voting
When a user has an eligible neuron and would like to vote on an open proposal, one option is to directly vote to adopt or reject the proposal.
Currently, the most user-friendly way to first find and [vote on open proposals](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/nns/using-the-nns-dapp/nns-dapp-voting-on-proposals) is via the
 NNS dapp: https://nns.ic0.app/.

For more information how a user can set up their neuron to delegate its voting power using liquid democracy, refer to
[following](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/nns/using-the-nns-dapp/nns-dapp-following-other-neurons).
