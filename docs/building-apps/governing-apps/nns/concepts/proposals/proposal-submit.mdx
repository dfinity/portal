# Submitting

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

To submit a proposal, it is recommended to use a neuron that can be controlled with a command line tool.
This guide will show how this can be done using an example of a motion proposal.
You can find another example for how to submit a proposal on [registering a known neuron](/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/nns/concepts/neurons/becoming-a-known-neuron).


## How to submit a motion proposal
This section explains one way to submit NNS motion proposals by using a few command line tools and a self-custody neuron.

### Background
To properly follow what is going on, there are a few high-level points worth highlighting:

#### Only Neurons can submit NNS proposals

Neurons with at least 10 ICP and 6 months of dissolve delay can submit NNS proposals. Therefore, the first step is to create such a neuron.

#### The NNS governance canister accepts motion proposals

The [governance](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34574082263700-Tokenomics-Governance) canister is a canister like any other, so it has a Candid file, it accepts messages, etc. This article describes a way where you can have your local computer send a message to the governance canister (signed on behalf of a neuron) that contains a motion proposal.

### One-time setup
#### Install `dfx`

* `dfx` is a command line tool that will be used to send messages from your machine to the NNS.
[Install `dfx`](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install).
```
$ dfx [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>
```

#### Install `quill`

* `quill` is a minimalist "governance toolkit". It is a wrapper for crafting and sending messages to the NNS and managing one's neuron. [Install quill](https://github.com/dfinity/quill).

This article will assume that you execute `quill` on your local machine by running:
```
quill [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>
```

#### Create a neuron via command line tools

#### Create a `private.pem` (private/public keypair) and Ledger `account id`.

Before you start, you need a private/public keypair.

```
quill generate --pem-file private.pem
```

:::info
quill encrypts the identity by default.
:::

When returned, your `account ID` should look something like this:
`612ec300g9ec990da900d6ec45919e7d5dbb9fa0dd8e69c54d374df93aa28d57`.

#### Link this private/public keypair to `dfx` so you can use it as an identity.

To use the identity with `dfx`, first you must decrypt the `private.pem` file:

```
quill decrypt-pem private.pem
```

Then, import the pem file into `dfx`. In this case, the new identity is called "proposals".

```
dfx identity import proposals private.pem
```

If you see the message “creating identity: proposals” in the terminal, this means it worked.

Alternatively, you can also import your identity using the seed file:

```
dfx identity import --seed-file seed.txt
```

[Learn more about dfx identities](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/identities).

#### Send ICP to the previously created `account id`.

You should send at least 10.001 in order to have enough ICP to create a neuron and pay for the ledger transaction fees.

To send ICP to the account, all you need is to input the `account id` in your wallet of choice.

#### Stake a neuron

To stake a neuron using quill, run the following command:

```
// Craft a message to stake a neuron by choosing an 8-character $NAME and an $AMOUNT to stake
// Note: you need to stake at LEAST 10 ICP to send proposals as $AMOUNT
quill --pem-file private.pem neuron-stake --name $NAME --amount $AMOUNT > message.json

// Send the message crafted above.
quill send message.json
```

You should see a message with a neuron ID staked. If successful, response will return `neuron ID:
9_218_890_096_040_352_708`. This means the neuron ID is `9218890096040352708`.

#### Increase neuron dissolve to at least 6 months

Time is measured in seconds on the NNS. One year in seconds equals 31557600 seconds.

```
// Craft message to increase dissolve delay of neuron to 1 year
quill --pem-file private.pem neuron-manage 9218890096040352708 --additional-dissolve-delay-seconds 31557600 > message.json

//send message created above to the NNS
quill send message.json
```

### How to send a proposal

This sections shows how to create a motion proposal, such as proposal #42626, [Open Governance canister for SNS, Design proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/42626).

#### Craft a proposal in markdown

The IC dashboard and the NNS frontend dapp both render markdown of the `summary` field. It is recommended to use standard markdown for your motion proposal.

Below is an example of using markdown for a NNS motion proposal:

```md
## Objective

Service nervous systems (SNSes) are algorithmic DAOs that allow developers to create decentralized, token-based governance systems 
for their dapps. The proposed governance canister design is similar to the  governance canister of the Network Nervous System (NNS) 
but simpler and more flexible, allowing each SNS community to choose the configurations according to their needs. This design is 
also presented and discussed in this forum post: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-governance-canister-for-sns-design-proposal/10224 .

## Background

### Relation to the original SNS design & overall approach
DFINITY Foundation presented a first proposed [SNS design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4443aaAP5A) in October 2021.

## Community conversation and timeline
The NNS team is ready to work on this feature!
To get the design approved by the community, the following schedule was followed:

* Jan 11-18th: Design discussion on the forum thread
* Jan 18th: Community conversation about the topic
* Jan 20th: Developer discussion on Discord
* today: motion proposal submission proposing the above design

## What is being asked of:

* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion
* Participate in technical discussions as the motion moves forward
```

#### Proposal submission

Below is an abstract example of a motion proposal submission. `dfx` is used to call the `manage_neuron` method of the NNS' governance canister, where `rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai` is the governance canister's ID. The placeholders `$TITLE`, `$MOTION_TEXT`,`$SUMMARY`, and`$NEURON_ID` are not variables. For a real submission, you need to replace them with real values directly within the command.

```
dfx --identity proposals canister --network ic call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron '(record {id = null; command=opt variant {MakeProposal=record {url=""; title=opt "$TITLE";action=opt variant {Motion=record {motion_text="$MOTION_TEXT"}}; summary="

$SUMMARY

"}}; neuron_id_or_subaccount=opt variant {NeuronId=record {id=$NEURON_ID:nat64}}})'
```

Next is an example of a submission where the placeholders are replaced with real values:

```
dfx --identity proposals canister --network ic call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron '(record {id = null; command=opt variant {MakeProposal=record {url=""; title="Open Governance canister for SNS | Design proposal";action=opt variant {Motion=record {motion_text="Present design proposal for Open Governance canister"}}; summary="

## Objective

Service nervous systems (SNSes) are algorithmic DAOs that allow developers to create decentralized, token-based governance systems for their dapps. The proposed governance canister design is similar to the  governance canister of the Network Nervous System (NNS) but simpler and more flexible, allowing each SNS community to choose the configurations according to their needs. This design is also presented and discussed in this forum: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-governance-canister-for-sns-design-proposal/10224 .

"}}; neuron_id_or_subaccount=opt variant {NeuronId=record {id=9218890096040352708:nat64}}})'
```

##### Check successful submission 

If successful, `dfx` will return an output such as:

```
(
  record {
    2_171_433_291 = opt variant {
      3_217_030_240 = record {
        2_744_746_248 = opt record { 23_515 = 42_626 : nat64 };
      }
    };
  },
)
```

In this example, `42_626` (or rather `42626`) is the ID of the proposal. Your proposal will have a different ID. You will be able to see your proposal at the URL `https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/42626`.


### Best practices for motion proposals

#### Writing the proposal

The proposal can accept any free form text. Additional information may be referenced but the text should be self-contained. This is an outline that may be used as starting point:

```
# Example Motion Project Proposal

## 1. Objective
Lorem Ipsum

## 2. Background
Lorem Ipsum

## 3. Why this is important
Lorem Ipsum

## 4. Pros
Lorem Ipsum

## 5. Cons
Lorem Ipsum

## 6. Key milestones (if any)
Lorem Ipsum

## 7. Discussion leads (if any)
Alice, Bob, etc...

## 8. Security concerns (if any)
Lorem Ipsum

## 11. What is asked of the community

* Review comments, ask questions, give feedback

* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion

Link to forum discussion: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-tokenomics-proposal/9392/3
```

#### Communicating the proposal

Once the proposal is live, it will be open to voting for 4 days, and if there is a lot of contesting of votes, that deadline will be automatically extended up to an additional 4 days.

Proposals typically require significant communication and promotion (like in any organization) to make sure enough people vote for it. It is very common for proposals to be promoted 'before' submission so its intended voters are aware of it. It is good practice to reference such preceding discussions in the motion proposal but voters should not be required to read them.
