# Launching an SNS

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

This section describes the SNS launch process in detail.
The launch process only requires one single NNS proposal that will, if adopted, trigger the creation of the SNS canisters as well as starting and finishing the decentralization swap.
The section begins with a detailed description of [each stage of an SNS launch](./launch-summary-1proposal.mdx).
Then, it explains the practical [commands and actions used throughout SNS launch](./launch-steps-1proposal.mdx), such as the tools and commands that are needed to take a project through each stage and launch an SNS for it.
