# Testing an SNS locally

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Tutorial"]} />

To help developers, DFINITY has created the [sns-testing repo](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing) which has scripts that help developers test the SNS process. Developers can run a local version of the ICP execution environment on their local machine, deploy their dapp locally, and run through [the stages of decentralizing their dapp](../launching/launch-summary-1proposal.mdx).

:::info
`sns-testing` repo might not work for all dapps. It is intended to showcase one example dapp, and so one can tweak it for their own dapp.
:::

After having [chosen the initial SNS parameters in a .yaml file](../tokenomics/preparation.mdx) and before requesting an SNS launch in production, the SNS launch should be tested locally.

**The main intent of the `sns-testing` repo is for a developer to test the actual process of decentralizing their dapp.**

Among other things, developers can use the `sns-testing` repo to:

- Initiate proposals.
- Pass proposals.
- Start decentralization swaps.
- Upgrade dapp via DAO voting.

:::info
`sns-testing` is just one form of testing the SNS process locally. Developers should feel free to use others, fork/modify `sns-testing`, or create their own.
:::

## Using the `sns-testing` repo

These scripts have been most tested with a stack that looks like this:

- A single canister that is being decentralized.
- A canister that can be deployed to a local development environment via `dfx deploy`.

## Getting started

To use the `sns-testing` commands and their arguments properly, you need to first [set up the `sns-testing` repo properly](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing#sns-lifecycle).

:::info
- All of the commands in this article require `sns-testing` to be set up properly.
- If you have started using `sns-testing` before August 2023 and are using the [old legacy flow of launching an SNS](../launching/index.mdx), please continue your work with the [legacy documentation](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing/blob/v1-legacy/README.md). In particular,
    - If you were following the Apple silicon-only instructions, please switch to the `v1-legacy` Git tag.
    - If you were using the Docker-based deployment approach, please use the Docker image: `docker pull ghcr.io/dfinity/sns-testing:v1-legacy`.

### Testing stages of the SNS launch process

For simplicity, next are the stages introduced in the [SNS launch stages documentation](../launching/launch-summary-1proposal.mdx) in the [commands and actions to go through SNS launch](../launching/launch-steps-1proposal.mdx) are mapped to the relevant scripts in the `sns-testing` repo so you can learn what part of the launch is tested in which script.
Note that some developers have dapps that do not match the narrow cases of `sns-testing`, so the table also includes a column for what other developers have experienced.

## Stages

### 0. Deploy a dapp to the local development environment.

#### Option 1: Testing a pre-packaged dapp created in `sns-testing` just for purposes of testing

```bash
./deploy_test_canister.sh
```

#### Option 2: Deploying your own single-canister dapp

```bash
dfx deploy
```

#### Option 3: Deploying your own multi-canister dapp

In this case, you should use whatever scripts or setup you have to deploy your dapp.

### 1. Dapp developers add NNS root as co-controller of dapp.

They can do so by running the following command:

Option 1: You have one canister.

```bash
dfx sns prepare-canisters add-nns-root $CANISTER_ID
```

Option 2: You have many canisters; run it for each canister ID.

```bash
dfx sns prepare-canisters add-nns-root $CANISTER_ID_1
dfx sns prepare-canisters add-nns-root $CANISTER_ID_2
...
dfx sns prepare-canisters add-nns-root $CANISTER_ID_N
```

### 2. Dapp developers choose the initial parameters of the SNS for a dapp.

Typically, dapp developers choose initial parameters that will be used in subsequent proposals.

Fill out this file:

```bash
example_sns_init.yaml
```

:::info
If you see an error along the lines of "missing field \`Principals\` at line 4 column 1," it means you need to upgrade `dfx sns` to version 0.4.1 or later. The command to do so is `dfx extension install sns --version 0.4.1`. You may first need to remove the existing version of `dfx sns` by running `dfx sns uninstall sns`.
:::

### 3. Submit NNS proposal to create SNS.

Submit an NNS proposal that ingests the `example_sns_init.yaml` file from stage #2.

```bash
dfx sns propose --network local --neuron $NEURON_ID example_sns_init.yaml
```

- `$NEURON_ID` comes from the `sns-testing` setup

### 4. The NNS proposal is decided.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. Community votes.

### 5. (Automated) SNS-W deploys SNS canisters.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

### 6. (Automated) SNS-W sets SNS root as the sole controller of dapp.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

### 7. (Automated) SNS-W initializes SNS canisters according to settings from Step 1:

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

### 8. (Automated) SNS swap starts.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

```bash
./participate_in_sns_swap.sh
```

### 9. (Automated) SNS swap ends.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

### 10. (Automated) SNS swap finalizes.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

### Testing the upgrading and managing of an SNS

Once a canister or dapp has been handed over to an SNS, it will be updated via proposals and voting. Developers can test this flow by [using commands from `sns-testing`](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing#sns-lifecycle).


| Action | Example in `sns-testing` |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Upgrade a yet-to-be-decentralized canister by submitting an SNS proposal that can be voted on using the SNS developer neuron. | `./upgrade_test_canister.sh` |
| Submit proposal to upgrade a decentralized canister | `./upgrade_test_canister.sh` |
| Vote on a proposal that upgrades a decentralized canister | `./vote_on_sns_proposal.sh` |

You might also want to test integrations and basic SNS functionality.
For this purpose you can use the above instructions after the test SNS is
launched or use the [SNS test flight on mainnet](testing-on-mainnet.mdx).
