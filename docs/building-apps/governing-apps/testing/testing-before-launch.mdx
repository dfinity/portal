# SNS testing before launch

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

Before SNS creation, it is advisable to thoroughly test the process.

## Testing on a local machine

Developers can **[test on a local machine](./testing-locally.mdx)**. The [sns-testing repository](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing) contains scripts that help developers test the SNS creation process. They can deploy the dapp in a local canister development environment and run through [the stages of decentralizing their dapp](../launching/launch-summary-1proposal.mdx).

**The main intent of the `sns-testing` repo is for a developer to test the actual process of decentralizing their dapp.**

Among other things, developers can use the `sns-testing` repo to:
- Initiate proposals.
- Pass proposals.
- Start decentralization swaps.
- Upgrade the dapp via DAO voting.

:::info
`sns-testing` is just one form of testing the SNS process locally. Developers should feel free to use others, fork/modify `sns-testing`, or create their own.

## Testing on the mainnet

Once a developer has tested the process of an SNS, it is highly recommended they do [an **"SNS testflight" on mainnet**](./testing-on-mainnet.mdx). An SNS test flight is when a developer deploys their dapp (to the mainnet) and hands control of it to a mock SNS (on the mainnet).

**The main intent of performing an SNS test flight is for developers to experience how a dapp works *after* it has been decentralized, so developers can make sure their dapp is ready for decentralization. It does not test the actual process of decentralizing it.**

:::info
A test flight is not a repository or a set of tools but an *activity* (deploying a dapp and handing control of it to a mock SNS), so the [instructions for testing on mainnet](./testing-on-mainnet.mdx) utilize various tools, but developers can of course use any tools they wish.
:::

Among other things, here are some examples of issues developers find when running an SNS test flight:
- They need a better pipeline for creating proposals to update a dapp.
- They may have decentralized prematurely and need to fix some things.
- They may need better monitoring before decentralizing.

The mock SNS used in an SNS test flight gives developers the ability to see what the post-decentralization lifecycle of a dapp looks like but still provides a way for a developer to keep control of their dapp. **Therefore, developers are encouraged to run and perform an SNS test flight on the mainnet, potentially for multiple days or weeks, to ensure that all aspects have been covered.**
