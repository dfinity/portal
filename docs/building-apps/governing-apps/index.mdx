# Service Nervous System (SNS)

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance" ]} />

These pages introduce instructions needed when considering handing over control of a dapp to a Service Nervous System (SNS) or integrating with an SNS.
If this is the first time you hear about the SNS, it is recommended to take a look at the high-level [SNS](/sns) and [FAQ](/sns/faq) pages to get an overview of what is discussed in more detail here.

This page provides an overview of how the SNS developer documentation is organized and also lists references to other relevant SNS documentation.

## Before an SNS launch
This section introduces the ideas and tools needed when considering forming a DAO, including less technical aspects, such as designing a tokenomics proposal, as well as more technical aspects, such as how different configuration choices can technically be set in the SNS.

In this documentation you will find
- [An introduction to SNS preparation](./tokenomics/index.mdx).
- [Pre-deployment considerations](./tokenomics/predeployment-considerations.mdx) introducing some non-technical considerations to take into account when planning an SNS launch.
- A (technical) introduction to how to convert the configurations into [SNS parameters](./tokenomics/preparation.mdx).
- [The SNS launch checklist](./tokenomics/sns-checklist.mdx) providing a summary of what to consider when launching an SNS.

## Launching an SNS
This section of documentation explains the SNS launch in detail.
It contains:
- An [introduction of how to read the launch pages](./launching/index.mdx).
- A detailed [description of all stages included in an SNS launch](./launching/launch-summary-1proposal.mdx).
- [The technical actions that are needed to complete the SNS launch stages](./launching/launch-steps-1proposal.mdx).
- [Integrating with an SNS](./launching/integrating.mdx): This section not only targets developers that have a dapp that they would like to decentralize with an SNS, but also developers that want to build services that integrate with SNSes, such as wallet dapps or decentralized exchanges.

## Testing an SNS
An important part of preparing an SNS launch, integrating with an SNS, and managing an SNS is testing.
This section provides
- [An introduction to SNS testing](./testing/testing-before-launch.mdx).
- [Guidelines how to test an SNS locally](./testing/testing-locally.mdx), including the SNS launch.

## Managing an SNS
After an SNS is launched, the SNS community needs to manage it, including ensuring that the canisters have enough cycles, governing the dapp, and managing SNS canister upgrades.
This section includes
- [An introduction to managing an SNS](./managing/manage-sns-intro.mdx).
- [An introduction to SNS proposals](./managing/making-proposals.mdx).
- [Tips regarding cycles management for the canisters](./managing/cycles-usage.mdx).
- [An introduction to how to use the asset canister with an SNS-controlled dapp](./managing/sns-asset-canister.mdx).

## Explanations and guides for users
Finally, the website and Wiki contain information relevant for users of the SNS.

On the **website**, you will find **explanations on:**
- [SNS overview page](https://internetcomputer.org/sns).
- [SNS FAQ](https://internetcomputer.org/sns/faq) including, for example:
  - [A guide on how to participate in the SNS decentralization swap](/sns/faq#participate).

The **Wiki*- contains more information about
- [DAOs](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/DAO).
- [Service Nervous System (SNS)](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Service_Nervous_System_(SNS)).
- [Neurons' Fund](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Neurons_Fund).

The Wiki also contains guides for the following topics:
- [How to: get a DAO on ICP](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How_to_get_a_DAO_on_the_IC) providing a summary of how someone can get a DAO on ICP, but this is largely subsumed by the developer documentation here.
- [How to: SNS tokenomics configuration](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_SNS_tokenomics_configuration) providing material enabling teams to choose a tokenomics set-up for their SNS DAO.
- [How to: verify SNS decentralization swap proposal](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-to:_Verify_SNS_decentralization_sale_proposal) which is a guide on how to verify the NNS proposal that starts an SNS decentralization swap.
- [How to: interact with SNS canisters](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-to:_Interact_with_SNS_canisters) which is a guide on how to interact with SNS canisters.
- [How to: participate in the SNS decentralization swap via quill](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_Participate_in_the_SNS_decentralization_sale_via_quill), which is a command line tool for interacting with canisters.
- [How to: join the Neurons' Fund via quill](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_Join_the_Community_fund_via_quill), which is a command line tool for interacting with canisters.
