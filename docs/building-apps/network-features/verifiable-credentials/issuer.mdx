# Become an issuer

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

An **issuer** is a service or app that can issue a verifiable credential (VC) to a user. On ICP, an issuer is an exposed API that receives calls from an identity provider and does not trigger any workflows itself. To become an issuer, your canister must implement the issuer API as described in the [verifiable credential spec](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md).

Issuers receive credentials requests from relying parties through an identity provider such as Internet Identity (II). The end user must allow or revoke the communication before the credential is issued.

Internet Identity is used as the identity provider in this tutorial.

## Development of the issuer API

The issuer API consists of four endpoints:

1. [`vc_consent_message`](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md#1-consent-message): Responds with a message of consent to be displayed to the user to receive their approval of issuing the credentials.

2. [`derivation_origin`](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md#2-derivation-origin): Returns the URL used to derive the user's principal for the issuer.

3. [`prepare_credential`](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md#3-prepare-credential): Checks the validity of the request and prepares the actual credential requested.

4. [`get_credential`](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md#4-get-credential): Issues the actual credential requested by the user.

### Step 1: Obtain a consent message (`vc_consent_message`)

First, the identity provider sends a request to the issuer API endpoint `vc_consent_message` to get the consent message to show the user. A consent message is text shown to the user to confirm that they allow the issuing of a VC.

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/vc-playground/blob/b2f8cd5f5397b7b355b6503df5af3789834b79e9/issuer/src/main.rs#L677-L689
```

### Step 2: Implement a derivation origin (`derivation_origin`)

Next, the issuer API endpoint `derivation_origin` is called by the identity provider to obtain a URL to be used as the derivation origin for the user's principal.

If the issuer doesn't rely on alternative derivation origins, then it must return the canister's URL: `https://<issuer-canister-id>.icp0.io`.

If the issuer relies on the [alternative derivation origins](/references/ii-spec#alternative-frontend-origins) feature, the endpoint must return the same value for the `derivationOrigin` when logging in.

The returned value is subject to verification via .well-known/ii-alternative-origins, as described in the [alternative origins documentation](/references/ii-spec#alternative-frontend-origins).

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/vc-playground/blob/b2f8cd5f5397b7b355b6503df5af3789834b79e9/issuer/src/main.rs#L659-L675
```

### Step 3: Prepare the credentials (`prepare_credential`)

Before a credential can be issued, the request for the credential must be checked for validity using the `prepare_credential` API endpoint. The objective of this endpoint is to check the validity of the request and update the `certified_data` with a new root hash that includes the signature on the credential. Upon success, the actual credential is prepared.

For more details on how to validate the request or create the actual credential, check out the [VC specification](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md).

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/vc-playground/blob/b2f8cd5f5397b7b355b6503df5af3789834b79e9/issuer/src/main.rs#L557-L585
```

:::info
The value of `prepared_context` is used to transfer information between the `prepare_credential` and `get_credential` steps. It is up to the issuer API to decide on the content of this field since the issuer API creates `prepared_context` and is the only entity that consumes it.

For example, when using [canister signatures](/references/ic-interface-spec#canister-signatures)
`prepared_context` contains a time-stamped and unsigned VC, for which the canister signature will be available through the `get_credential` call.
:::

### Step 4: Issue the credential (`get_credential`)

Lastly, the issuer API endpoint `get_credential` is used to issue the credential requested by the user. The same checks used to prepare the credential are run again, with an additional verify step to confirm that `prepared_context` is consistent with `prepare_credential`. If successful, the issuer API returns the signed credential in JWT format.

An example implementation can be found in the [verifiable credentials playground example](

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/vc-playground/blob/b2f8cd5f5397b7b355b6503df5af3789834b79e9/issuer/src/main.rs#L601-L649
```

## Recommended conventions

An issuer may follow the convention below for an easier verification of the returned credentials.

Given a credential specification such as:

```json
"credentialSpec": {
    "credentialType": "SomeVerifiedProperty",
    "arguments": {
        "argument_1": "value_1",
        "another_argument": 42,
    }
}
```

The returned JWT should contain a property named by the value of `credentialType` in `credentialSubject` from the specification, with key-value entries listing the arguments from the specification, namely:

```json
"SomeVerifiedProperty": {
    "argument_1": "value_1",
    "another_argument": 42,
}
```

For example, for a `VerifiedAdult` credential, you would use the following credential specification:

```json
"credentialSpec": {
    "credentialType": "VerifiedAdult",
    "arguments": {
        "minAge": 18,
    }
}
```

A compliant issuer would issue a VC that contains `credentialSubject` with the property:

```json
"VerifiedAdult": {
    "minAge": 18,
}
```
