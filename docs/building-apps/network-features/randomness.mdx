# Onchain randomness

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

The Internet Computer provides a secure and verifiable way to generate random numbers directly within canisters. This functionality is exposed through the [raw_rand](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec) method offered by the [management canister](/docs/references/system-canisters/management-canister) and the [Motoko Random module](/docs/motoko/main/base/Random).

The method takes no input and returns 32 pseudo-random bytes to the caller.

## How it works
Behind the scenes, ICP utilizes a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to generate randomness.

During each round, the VRF is evaluated with the current input being the number of the round. This process produces a fresh set of random bytes.

These bytes become the seed for a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) called random tape. The random tape is built using [chain-key cryptography](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34209486239252-Chain-Key-Cryptography) and is used to create unique random values for each canister that requested randomness in the previous round.

`raw_rand` calls only use the random tape from the next round. This ensures that no one can exploit knowledge of the current round's randomness to predict future outputs. To learn more about the [execution layer](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34208985618836-Execution-Layer) of ICP, refer to the [execution layer documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/execution-layer/).

To learn more about the technical details of randomness on ICP, watch the [Community Conversations video on randomness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl5BuiWClD0).

## How to use
Developers can directly access randomness through the `raw_rand` method in the management canister. See the examples below.

<AdornedTabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

```motoko
import IC "ic:aaaaa-aa";

actor {
  public func random_bytes() : async Blob {
    await IC.raw_rand();
  };
};
```

In addition to the `raw_rand` method, Motoko offers a [Random module](/docs/motoko/main/base/Random) for generating random numbers.

## Externally verifiable randomness

The randomness obtained from `raw_rand` is secure and verifiable by inspecting the canister implementation, but it is not externally verifiable, for example, on another blockchain. Externally verifiable randomness can be obtained using vetKeys. See the [vetKeys documentation](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/verifiable-randomness) for more details.
