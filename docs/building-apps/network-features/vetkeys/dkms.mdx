# Distributed key management service

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "vetKeys", "Key manager"]} />

vetKeys can be used to facilitate a distributed key management service (DKMS).

vetKeys obtained from ICP are only known to the client that requested them, therefore they can be used by the client for different purposes such as encryption, signing, and further key derivation.
These keys can be shared with other users by adding corresponding user permissions in the canister.

We give an example implementation of DKMS in the `KeyManager` library, which offers access control and vetKey derivation.

## Why use `KeyManager`?

It is a **ready-to-use solution**. It offers:

- **Simple, cleartext frontend APIs** for key derivation. No need to define or manage your own cryptographic primitives.

- **Deterministic key generation**. Built on the **strong randomness** of vetKeys.

- Built-in **access control** for keys. No peer-to-peer interaction required. Parties receiving access permissions donâ€™t need to be online during the process. 

- Enhanced security when fetching keys on demand. Avoids persisting sensitive keys locally, reducing the risk of key compromise.

## How does `KeyManager` work?

A `KeyManager`-enabled canister determines access control to vetKeys. It controls what vetKeys a user owns and what vetKeys are shared with other users, including specific access rights (e.g., whether an added user can further share the vetKey). Furthermore, access control in `KeyManager` is flexible as well, such that it can be extended to further restrict access to vetKeys based on time.

Every vetKey identity in `KeyManager` is defined by the vetKey owner's principal and an arbitrary byte string. This separates the domains from which users can derive vetKeys, while still allowing them to derive arbitrary many vetKeys.

The `KeyManager` provides both frontend and backend libraries that are supposed to be used together.
The backend `KeyManager` library provides a component that should be added to the canister.
The frontend `KeyManager` library provides a way to interact with the backend `KeyManager` component inside a canister.
The developer's role in the implementation is to define what canister APIs need to be called and how in order to let the frontend library communicate with the backend component.

`KeyManager` handles the following:

- **Retrieve and decrypt vetKeys**: Securely fetch encrypted vetKeys and decrypt them locally using a transport secret key. The frontend `KeyManager` API abstracts away this process, returning just the decrypted vetKey in the frontend.

- **Retrieve vetKey verification key**: Obtain the public verification key used to validate encrypted vetKeys.

- **Access shared key information**: Query which vetKeys a user has access permissions to.

- **Manage key access**: Assign, update, or revoke user access rights for stored vetKeys.

## How to use `KeyManager`?

To set up `KeyManager` for your dapp, you need to instantiate the backend `KeyManager` component in your canister and configure how your frontend will communicate with it.

In the **backend**, you can define that whenever someone calls particular APIs of the canister, it calls the corresponding `KeyManager`'s method. For example, if a canister's `set_user_rights` API is called, the canister makes a function call to the `set_user_rights` method of its `KeyManager` instance. As an example, see the following [default `KeyManager` canister implementation](https://github.com/dfinity/vetkd-devkit/blob/3b1de5d546dcc32daaf22b21baaa2b220bc857f3/backend/rs/canisters/ic_vetkeys_manager_canister/src/lib.rs).

In the **frontend**, you can define that when the frontend method `set_user_rights` of `KeyManager` is called, then the frontend `KeyManager` makes a call to the canister API `set_user_rights`. This is done by implementing the [`KeyManagerClient`](https://5lfyp-mqaaa-aaaag-aleqa-cai.icp0.io/interfaces/ic_vetkeys_tools.KeyManagerClient.html) interface. As an example, see the [`DefaultKeyManagerClient`](https://github.com/dfinity/vetkd-devkit/blob/3b1de5d546dcc32daaf22b21baaa2b220bc857f3/frontend/ic_vetkeys/src/key_manager/key_manager_canister.ts) implementation of the `KeyManagerClient` interface.

### Step 4: Use `KeyManager` in the frontend

Your application's frontend can communicate with a `KeyManager`-enabled canister using the following TypeScript code:

<AdornedTabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript" default>

Instantiate and use `KeyManager` in the frontend.

```ts
import { KeyManager } from "ic_vetkeys/key_manager";

// Initialize the KeyManager
const keyManager = new KeyManager(keyManagerClientInstance);

// Retrieve shared keys
const sharedKeys = await keyManager.getAccessibleSharedKeyIds();

// Request and decrypt a vetKey
const keyOwner = Principal.fromText("aaaaa-aa");
const vetkeyName = "my_secure_key";
const vetkey = await keyManager.getVetKey(keyOwner, vetkeyName);

// Manage user access rights
const user = Principal.fromText("bbbbbb-bb");
const accessRights = { Read: null };
const result = await keyManager.setUserRights(keyOwner, vetkeyName, user, accessRights);
```
