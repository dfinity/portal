# vetKeys example

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Encryption"]} />

This example provides a canister (`src/chainkey_testing_canister`) that demonstrates how the [proposed vetKD system API](https://github.com/dfinity/portal/pull/3763) can be used to encrypt, transfer, and decrypt a file sent to an Ethereum address.

The [GitHub repo for this example](https://github.com/kristoferlund/send_file_to_eth_demo) is a public template, and there is a live demo available: https://h62xu-2iaaa-aaaal-qshoq-cai.icp0.io/

It uses [`ic-siwe`](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-siwe) and [`ic-siwe-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ic-siwe-js) to facilitate signing in with Ethereum, sending a file to an Ethereum address, and using the recipient's address to to identify the [IBE scheme](/docs/references/vetkeys-overview) used to generate a public key for the recipient.

Other examples available are:

- [Rust encryption app](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/vetkd).
- [Encrypted notes dapp](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/encrypted-notes-dapp-vetkd).

## Encrypt and store a file

### Step 1: Retrieve recipient's public key

First, identify the Ethereum address of the recipient you'd like to send a file to. Then, define a `vetkd_public_key` method that will retrieve the recipient's public key using their Ethereum address to identify the IBE scheme that generates the public key. This method will call the `chainkey_testing_canister`:

```rust reference
https://github.com/kristoferlund/send_file_to_eth_demo/blob/main/src/backend/src/vetkd/controller/vetkd_public_key.rs#L1-L23
```

:::info
This example uses a local test vetKeys canister. When the feature is available, this should be replaced with the actual vetKeys API.

### Step 2: Encrypt a file in the frontend

Next, define a request in the application's frontend that uses the recipient's public key and the `vetkd.IBECiphertext.encrypt` method from the `ic-vetkd-utils` package. This request will take the file uploaded by the user and encrypt it.

```typescript reference
https://github.com/kristoferlund/send_file_to_eth_demo/blob/main/src/frontend/src/transfer/hooks/useTransferCreate.tsx#L1-L46
```

### Step 3: Store the encrypted file in the backend

In the backend canister, create a `transfer_create` method that verifies the frontend request's `from` and `to` parameters, then stores the encrypted file:

```rust reference
https://github.com/kristoferlund/send_file_to_eth_demo/blob/main/src/backend/src/transfer/controller/transfer_create.rs#L1-L35
```

## Receive and decrypt a file

### Step 1: Obtain a list of available encrypted file transfers

The file has now been encrypted with the intended recipient's Ethereum address and corresponding private key. In order for the recipient to receive the file, they must login to the application with their Ethereum address. The frontend will call the backend's `transfer_list` method and receive the application's existing file transfers.

```rust reference
https://github.com/kristoferlund/send_file_to_eth_demo/blob/main/src/backend/src/transfer/controller/transfer_list.rs#L1-L15
```

### Step 2: Obtain the recipient's private key

Then the backend obtains the encrypted private key of the user's Ethereum address in a similar manner to how it obtained the public key to encrypt the file:

```rust reference
https://github.com/kristoferlund/send_file_to_eth_demo/blob/main/src/backend/src/vetkd/controller/vetkd_encrypted_key.rs#L1-L31
```

### Step 3: Decrypt the private key and file

Finally, the frontend decrypts the private key, uses it to decrypt the file, and returns the file to the user:

```typescript reference
https://github.com/kristoferlund/send_file_to_eth_demo/blob/main/src/frontend/src/transfer/hooks/useTransferGet.tsx#L1-L46
```
