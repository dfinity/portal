# What are advanced uses cases of vetKeys?

You can use vetKeys for several advanced used cases.

## [Blockchain-issued BLS signatures](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/advanced/bls-signatures)

vetKeys can be used as signatures issued by the blockchain. This is especially useful for blockchains that don't have a built-in certification feature enabling dapps to sign statements.

It can also be used to efficiently bridge blockchains, e.g., to swap assets in a DeFi application. A dapp on one blockchain can verify signed statements issued by a second blockchain without having to implement a complete light client of that second chain.

## [Identity-based encryption (IBE)](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/advanced/identity-based-encryption)

IBE enables encryption directly to a userâ€™s identity. In this model, the dapp controls identity assignment, for example, associating each user with their ICP principal. Each user can then obtain a `vetKey`, which functions as their IBE decryption key, allowing them to decrypt messages or data encrypted to their identity.

Compared to DKMS, IBE works differently. In DKMS, one or more users share **the same** symmetric key, and only those users can encrypt and decrypt data using that key.

In contrast, IBE is an **asymmetric encryption** scheme. Anyone can encrypt messages to a given identity, including other users or canisters, but only the holder of the corresponding decryption key can decrypt them. IBE is more advanced as it builds a full asymmetric encryption system using vetKeys rather than relying solely on symmetric key derivation.

## [Timelock encryption](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/advanced/timelock-encryption)

Timelock encryption enables a sender to encrypt a message for the future, ensuring that it will get decrypted at a given time, but no earlier than that time. Timelock encryption can be achieved via IBE by letting the dapp release the IBE decryption keys corresponding to the current time at regular intervals (eventually decrypting the cipher texts in the canister) and letting the sender IBE-encrypt its message using the desired decryption time as identity. More sophisticated timelock conditions are also possible (see below).

### "Dead man's switch"

Journalists or whistleblowers could ensure that compromising information in their possession is automatically published if they were to become incapacitated. They can store the information in a dapp, encrypted using IBE that the dapp automatically and publicly recovers when a certain amount of time passes after it last received an authenticated ping from its owner.

### Private auctions and MEV protection

In a private auction dapp, users can submit bids that are IBE-encrypted under an identifier so that at the end of the auction, the dapp can decrypt all bids with a single vetKey evaluation. A similar technique can be used to prevent front-running, also known as miner-extracted value (MEV), on a decentralized exchange (DEX). Users submit their IBE-encrypted transactions under a predictable batch identifier. The DEX orders the transactions in encrypted form and, when all transactions for a particular batch have been ordered, triggers the recovery of the decryption key for that batch and executes the decrypted transactions in the fixed order. Note that all of the symmetric-encryption use cases listed above can be modified to encrypt using an IBE instead of a symmetric-key encryption, thereby eliminating the need to perform a vetKey derivation for encryption. Decryption, of course, still requires retrieving a vetKey.

### Advanced timelocks

Anyone can IBE-encrypt their message using some more complex condition as identity, while a dapp lets anyone who can satisfy the condition (or when the condition is satisfied on its own) to obtain the respective vetKey. This enables quite interesting use cases, as it enables one to encrypt to any verifiable future event, e.g., the price of a stock going above or below a certain level, information escrow, or break-the-glass policies.

## [Externally verifiable randomness](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/advanced/verifiable-randomness)

Because of their uniqueness, vetKeys can also act as a Verifiable Random Function (VRF). Trusted, verifiable randomness is important for applications such as trustless online lotteries and casinos, fair decentralized games (GameFi), and selecting random features for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
