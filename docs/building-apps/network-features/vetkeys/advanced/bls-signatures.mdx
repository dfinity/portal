# BLS Signatures from vetKeys

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "BLS Signature"]} />

vetKeys can be used for distributed signing using the BLS algorithm.

## Signing Process

The signing process works as follows:
- The canister defines access rules for vetKeys, for example, based on principals
- The canister calls the management canister API to produce an encrypted signature
- If the signature does not need to be private, the canister can provide a dummy transport key, decrypt the vetkey, and then return the decrypted BLS signature
- The canister returns the encrypted signature to the client

## Signature Verification

- The canister or the client can derive the public key to verify signatures
