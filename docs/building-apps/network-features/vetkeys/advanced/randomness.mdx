# Externally Verifiable Randomness

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

## Why Verifiable Randomness

Internet Computer vetKeys can be used to produce **externally verifiable randomness**. This is useful to prove that the randomness was produced in the intended way. For example, in a web3 lottery or in the generation of random NFT properties, it is sometimes crucial that the used randomness can be verified by external users.

## How It Works

The process works as follows:
- It can be proved that a vetKey was derived with correct arguments
- Derive a vetKey for a request ID
- The canister decrypts the vetKey
- The hash of the vetKey serves as randomness
- The vetKey and the public key serve as the proof
- The hash is the randomness

## How to Use

More detailed implementation instructions and code snippets for using verifiable randomness with vetKeys will be provided in future updates, including:
- How to instantiate a Verifiable Random Function (VRF)
- How to instantiate a random beacon
