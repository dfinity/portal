# Timelock encryption

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

Timelock encryption builds upon identity-based encryption (IBE). For more information about IBE, please refer to the [identity-based encryption documentation](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/advanced/identity-based-encryption).

It is useful to add time restrictions on when an IBE private key can be accessed. Additionally, the canister can decrypt IBE-encrypted data when appropriate conditions are met.

## Use cases

#### Private auction 

Multiple users can create bids on an auction lot. The canister decrypts the bids once the lot is closed and decides on the winner.

#### Miner extractable value protection

For miner extractable value (MEV) protection, multiple users create transactions and the canister orders them. The canister only then decrypts the amount to prevent front-running, where a malicious user tries to make use of market fluctuations.

#### Birthday coupon

A user can encrypt a coupon or gift, send it to another user, who can only decrypt it after a certain delay such as the time until their birthday.
