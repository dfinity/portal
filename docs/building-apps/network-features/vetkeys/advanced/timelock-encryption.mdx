# Time-lock encryption

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

Timelock encryption builds upon Identity-Based Encryption (IBE). For more information about IBE, please refer to the [Identity-Based Encryption documentation](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/advanced/identity-based-encryption).

It is useful to add time restrictions on when an IBE private key can be accessed. Additionally, the canister can decrypt IBE-encrypted data when appropriate conditions are met.

## Use Cases

### Secret-Bid Auction & MEV Protection

Multiple bidders can create bids on an auction lot. The canister decrypts the bids once the lot is closed and decides on the winner. 

TODO: code snippets and explanation

For MEV (Miner Extractable Value) protection, multiple users create transactions and the canister orders them, and only then decrypts the amount to prevent front-running, where a malicious user tries to make use of market fluctuations.

### Birthday Coupon

One user encrypts a birthday coupon and the other user can only decrypt it after a certain delay, making it a time-based surprise gift.

## Implementation Examples

Detailed code examples for implementing timelock encryption with vetKeys will be provided in future updates, including:
- Secret-bid auction implementation
- Birthday coupon implementation
