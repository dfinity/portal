# What are vetKeys?

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Encryption"]} />

vetKeys (verifiably encrypted threshold keys) on the Internet Computer (ICP) make it easier for developers to implement encryption, threshold decryption, and threshold signing in their dapps. They are powered by the vetKD (verifiably encrypted threshold key derivation) protocol, which enables secure, on-demand key derivation. With vetKeys, a public blockchain like ICP can hold and work with secret data securely.

The goal of vetKeys is to simplify the use of security and privacy tools on ICP. Encrypting data locally and storing it onchain is straightforward, since the secret key stays on the device. However, challenges arise when a user wants to access that data from another device or share it with someone else, as there’s no easy, privacy-preserving way to transmit secret key material across public channels. vetKeys solve this by enabling secure, on-demand key access without exposing secrets.

- **Verifiable**: users can verify the correctness of the derived vetKeys, and that they have not being tampered with.

- **Encrypted**: the derived vetKeys are encrypted under a user-provided transport key. This ensures that neither individual nodes nor the network ever have access to a user’s private vetKeys.

- **Threshold**: vetKeys are derived in a distributed manner, requiring a contribution of a threshold of nodes in a subnet. No single ever sees the derived vetKeys, ensuring that no central authority can derive or reconstruct them.

- **Keys**: key material that can be used to further derive strong cryptographic keys, such as encryption and signature keys.

## vetKD API

The low-level API of the vetKD protocol that is used to obtain vetKeys and the cost of the calls to that API are described on [this page](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/api.mdx).

## vetKeys use cases and applications

The availability of vetKeys allows for a series of applications, including but not limited to those covered in the following sections.

### Distributed key management service (DKMS)

DKMS is an abstraction on top of vetKeys, designed to simplify obtaining and managing access permissions to vetKeys. It allows users to securely generate, manage, and share cryptographic keys using vetKeys and ICP. These vetKeys can then be used for encryption, decryption, or data signing. Read [here](/docs/building-dapps/network-features/vetkeys/dkms) about how DKMS can be instantiated in your dapp.

### Encrypted onchain storage

Encrypted onchain storage is another abstraction on top of DKMS that enables data encryption using vetKeys in the frontend, storage of the encrypted data, and management of access permissions. 
Its goal is twofold:
1. Simplify developing dapps that make use of data encryption and storage of encrypted data using vetKeys, especially for developers without cryptographic expertise.
2. Enable a blockchain to securely and efficiently encrypt and host data at scale to support millions of users and billions of secrets.

The following [page](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/encrypted-onchain-storage) describes how to use encrypted onchain storage in your dapp.

### Advanced

You can use vetKeys to instantiate advanced cryptographic primitives: BLS signatures, identity-baseed encryption (IBE), timelock encryption, and verifiable randomness generation. See [what are advanced use cases of vetKeys](/docs/building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/advanced/introduction) page for more details.
