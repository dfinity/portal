# `KeyManager`

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Key manager"]} />

<!---------

`KeyManager` is a component provided in the distributed key management service (DKMS) offering access control and derivation of vetKeys. Each vetKey's identity is defined as a pair: 

1. The owner's ICP principal.

2. An arbitrary byte string.
`KeyManager` provides the following core features:

- **Retrieve and decrypt vetKeys**: Securely fetch encrypted vetKeys and decrypt them locally using a transport secret key. The frontend `KeyManager` API abstracts this process, returning only the decrypted vetKey to the developer.

- **Retrieve vetKey verification key**: Obtain the public verification key used to validate encrypted vetKeys.

- **Access shared key information**: Query which vetKeys a user has permission to access.

- **Manage key access**: Assign, update, or revoke user access rights for stored vetKeys.

## End-to-end setup

To set up `KeyManager` for your dapp, you need to configure how your frontend will communicate with the `KeyManager` component on the backend.

In the **backend**, you can define that whenever someone calls particular APIs of the canister, it calls the corresponding `KeyManager`'s method. For example, if a canister's `set_user_rights` API is called, the canister makes a function call to the `set_user_rights` method of its `KeyManager` instance. As an example, see the following [default `KeyManager` canister implementation](https://github.com/dfinity/vetkd-devkit/blob/3b1de5d546dcc32daaf22b21baaa2b220bc857f3/backend/rs/canisters/ic_vetkeys_manager_canister/src/lib.rs).

In the **frontend**, you can define that when the frontend method `set_user_rights` of `KeyManager` is called, then the frontend `KeyManager` makes a call to the canister API `set_user_rights`. This is done by implementing the [`KeyManagerClient`](https://5lfyp-mqaaa-aaaag-aleqa-cai.icp0.io/interfaces/ic_vetkeys_tools.KeyManagerClient.html) interface. As an example, see the [`DefaultKeyManagerClient`](https://github.com/dfinity/vetkd-devkit/blob/3b1de5d546dcc32daaf22b21baaa2b220bc857f3/frontend/ic_vetkeys/src/key_manager/key_manager_canister.ts) implementation of the `KeyManagerClient` interface.

## Application frontend component

Your application's frontend can communicate with a `KeyManager`-enabled canister using the following TypeScript code:

<AdornedTabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript" default>

Instantiate and use `KeyManager` in the frontend.

```ts
import { KeyManager } from "ic_vetkeys/key_manager";

// Initialize the KeyManager
const keyManager = new KeyManager(keyManagerClientInstance);

// Retrieve shared keys
const sharedKeys = await keyManager.getAccessibleSharedKeyIds();

// Request and decrypt a vetKey
const keyOwner = Principal.fromText("aaaaa-aa");
const vetkeyName = "my_secure_key";
const vetkey = await keyManager.getVetKey(keyOwner, vetkeyName);

// Manage user access rights
const user = Principal.fromText("bbbbbb-bb");
const accessRights = { Read: null };
const result = await keyManager.setUserRights(keyOwner, vetkeyName, user, accessRights);
```

</TabItem>
</AdornedTabs>
