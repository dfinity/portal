# Periodic tasks and timers

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

Unlike other blockchains, ICP canisters can automatically execute tasks after a specified delay or interval.

There are two ways to schedule an automatic canister execution on ICP:

1. **Timers**: Single-expiration or periodic canister calls with specified minimum timeout or interval. A canister can implement multiple timers. Each timer will receive a unique ID to identify it within the context of the canister.
2. **Heartbeats**: Legacy periodic canister invocations with intervals close to the blockchain finalization rate (1s). Heartbeats are supported by ICP for backward compatibility and some very special use cases. **Newly developed canisters should prefer using timers over the heartbeats.**

## Timers

Timers are implemented on two layers:

- **The protocol level implementation:** The Internet Computer protocol supports one minimalistic global timer per canister via the `ic0.global_timer_set()` system API call and `canister_global_timer` handler (see the [Internet Computer interface specification](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec#timer)).
- **The CDK timers library level:** The library wraps the minimalistic protocol implementation, adding multiple and periodic timers on top. Canister developers can enjoy the familiar timers functionality using the CDK timers library for:

    - [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/ic-cdk-timers)

    - [Motoko](/docs/motoko/icp-features/timers)

    - [TypeScript (Azle)](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/timers.html)

    - [Python (Kybra)](https://demergent-labs.github.io/kybra/timers.html)

Internally the CDK timers libraries do the following:

1. The library keeps a global list of all periodic tasks inside the canister.
2. Calls the `ic0.global_timer_set()` system API to schedule the next task from the list.
3. Implements the `canister_global_timer` method with the following logic:
    - For each expired task, the handler initiates a self-canister call to isolate the tasks from each other and from the library code. Note, the [normal inter-canister call costs](/docs/building-apps/essentials/gas-cost) apply.
    - Reschedules periodic tasks at the end of their execution.
    - Calls the `ic0.global_timer_set()` system API to schedule the next task.

The library does not handle canister upgrades. It is up to the canister developer to serialize the timers in the `canister_pre_upgrade` hook and reactivate the timers in the `canister_post_upgrade` method if necessary.

Using pre_ and post_upgrade hooks is discouraged. It is error-prone and can render a canister unusable. Per best practices, using these methods should be avoided if possible.

For the code composability reasons, i.e., to be able to use different libraries with timers in a single project, canister developers are encouraged to use the CDK timers libraries over the protocol-level API or the heartbeats.

To use multiple timers in a canister, simply create multiple timer definitions.

### Timers library limitations

Despite its superiority over the heartbeats, the CDK timers library has a few known shortcomings:

- **Canister upgrades:** The library keeps a global list of multiple and periodic tasks inside the canister heap. During a canister upgrade, a fresh WebAssembly state is created, all the timers are deactivated, and the list of timers is cleared. It is up to the canister developer to serialize the timers in the `canister_pre_upgrade` and reactivate them in the `canister_post_upgrade` method if needed.
- **Self canister calls:** To isolate the tasks from each other and from the scheduling logic, the CDK timers library initiates a self canister call to execute each task. There are a few implications:

    - Normal [inter-canister call costs](/docs/building-apps/essentials/gas-cost) apply to execute each task. Note, timers are [still more cost effective](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/periodic_tasks) than the heartbeats.
    - The tasks to execute are added at the end of the canister input queue. Depending on the canister and [subnet](https://learn.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/articles/34209955782420-Subnet-Creation) load, the actual execution might be delayed.

- As the canister output queue is limited in size (500 messages at the moment), this implicitly limits the number of tasks that might be scheduled in one round.

- **Advanced scheduling:** The CDK timers library uses relative time to schedule tasks. To use an absolute time, canister developers should calculate the duration between now and the point in time or use a third-party library.

## Heartbeats

Once an Internet Computer canister exports the `canister_heartbeat` function, it will be called every subnet heartbeat interval (see the [Internet Computer interface specification](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec#heartbeat)).

The only way to disable the heartbeats is to upgrade the canister to a version that does not export the `canister_heartbeat` method. Also, the heartbeat interval is implementation-defined, and there is no way to adjust it.

Because of those limitations, in most cases, the CDK timers library for [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/ic-cdk-timers) or [Motoko](/docs/motoko/icp-features/timers) is a better option to schedule periodic tasks.

## Frequently asked questions

- #### Do timers support deterministic time slicing (DTS)?
Yes, as the CDK timers library initiates a self-canister call to execute each task, normal [update message instruction limits](/docs/building-apps/canister-management/resource-limits) apply with DTS enabled.

- #### What happens if a timer handler awaits a call?
Normal await point rules apply: any new execution can start at the await point: a new message, another timer handler, or a heartbeat. Once that new execution is finished or reaches its await point, the execution of the current timer handler might be resumed.

- #### What happens if a 1s periodic timer is executing for 2s?
If there are no await points in the timer handler, the periodic timer will be rescheduled at the end of the execution. If there are await points, it's implementation-defined when the periodic timer is rescheduled.
