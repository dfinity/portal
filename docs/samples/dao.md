# Basic decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)

This sample project demonstrates a basic [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) (DAO) that can be deployed to the [Internet Computer](https://github.com/dfinity/ic). The basic DAO sample code is available in [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/basic_dao) and [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/basic_dao). You can see a quick introduction on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/3IcYlieA-EE).

## Overview

A `basic_dao` can be initialized with a set of accounts: mappings from principal IDs to an amount of tokens. Account owners can query their account balance by calling `account_balance` and transfer tokens to other accounts by calling `transfer`. Anyone can call `list_accounts` to view all accounts.

Account owners can submit proposals by calling `submit_proposal`. A proposal specifies a canister, method and arguments for this method. Account owners can cast votes (either `Yes` or `No`) on a proposal by calling `vote`. The amount of votes cast is equal to amount of tokens the account owner has. If enough `Yes` votes are cast, `basic_dao` will execute the proposal by calling the proposalâ€™s given method with the given args against the given canister. If enough `No` votes are cast, the proposal is not executed, and is instead marked as `Rejected`.

Certain system parameters, like the number of `Yes` votes needed to pass a proposal, can be queried by calling `get_system_params`. These system params can be modified via the proposal process, i.e. a proposal can be made to call `update_system_params` with updated values. The below demo does exactly that.
