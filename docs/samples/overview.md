- [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/minimal-counter-dapp).

## NFT minting

This NFT minting dapp showcases how easy it can be to create a user generated NFT and share it. This dapp uses the [DIP721](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DIP721) NFT standard.
- [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/dip721-nft-container).
- [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/1po3udDADp4).

## NFT wallet
This is an NFT wallet example dapp that utilizes minted NFTs from the Rust dip721-nft-container. Among some of its essential features, the wallet can register NFTs, transfer out NFTs and check how many NFTs it contains. This dapp includes a frontend UI for interaction.

- [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/nft-wallet).

## Periodic tasks

- [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/periodic_tasks).

## Persistent storage

The example dapp shows how to build a simple dapp in Motoko, which will have persistent storage. The dapp is a simple counter, which will increment a counter, retrieve the counter value and reset the counter value by calling backend functions. The functions are exposed through a Candid interface.

- [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/persistent-storage).

## Phone book

This simple dapp is a CRUD-like demo service for storing pieces of related information, such as names and phone numbers.

- [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/quicksort).

## QR code generator

This example shows that an Internet Computer dapp can perform a long-running computation, like image processing, in a single message execution which is possible due to a unique feature called Deterministic Time Slicing (DTS) that automatically divides long computations into smaller slices executed across multiple blocks.

- [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/qrcode).

## Explore further samples in Motoko

This is a collection of repo-links to additional code samples written in Motoko. Most are also available in the [Motoko playground](https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.raw.ic0.app/). The playground provides the simplest environment for trying out pure Motoko samples without having to download and learn to use the SDK, but does not support dapps with frontends.
