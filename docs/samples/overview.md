# Overview

Take a look at some sample dapps below and see the possibilities of building on the IC. All samples and further projects can be found in the [Samples repo](https://github.com/dfinity/examples). Additional resources can be found in the [Awesome Dfinity repo](https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-dfinity) (a curated set of open-source projects and examples from our community) or [Hackathon projects](hackathon-projects)!

## Hello world

## Basic decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)

Decentralized governance is higlight of the IC and is illustrated by the basic DAO sample code. It illustrates how to initialize a set of accounts and corresponding tokens, how account owners can sumit proposals for other account owners to vote on, and how a proposal is executed given enough favorable votes.

- [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/3IcYlieA-EE)

## Basic decentralized exchange (DEX)

To enable DEFI applications on the IC, canisters need to interact with token canisters and the ledger canister. This example dapp illustrates these interactions by showing how to enable an Exchange to take custody of funds, update an internal balance book as users trade, and give custody back to the user as funds are withdrawn.

## Encrypted note-taking dapp

Create, access, modify confidential notes from multiple devices using [Internet Identity](../references/ii-spec) service and end-to-end encryption. The sample code relies upon the **web-serving** and **storage capabilities** of the IC, and highlights two key functionalities: 
1. Client-side, end-to-end encryption.
2. Multi-user and multi-device support.

## Hosting a web game

The example shows how to deploy a web game on the IC, sample code can be found at [samples repo](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/hosting).   
- [Documentation](host-a-webgame)

## ICP transfer

This sample code demonstrates how a dapp can transfer ICP to its most active users.

- [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/tokens_transfer) 

## NFT minting

This NFT minting dapp showcases how easy it can be to create a user generated NFT and share it. This dapp uses the [DIP721](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DIP721) NFT standard.

## Explore further samples in Motoko

This is a collection of repo-links to additional code samples written in Motoko. Most are also available in the [Motoko playground](https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.raw.ic0.app/). The playground provides the simplest environment for trying out pure Motoko samples without having to download and learn to use the SDK, but does not support dapps with frontends.

### Basic

This is collection of basic getting-started Motoko samples, which demonstrate basic concepts of the IC and the Motoko language.

-   [Actor reference](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/actor_reference) shows the IC management canister as an actor (reference).

-   [Counter](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/counter) shows a basic (stable) variable demo.

-   [Echo](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/echo) gives a basic query function demo.

-   [Factorial](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/factorial) shows a basic factorial demo.

-   [Hello cycles](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/hello_cycles) illustrates how to receive and transfer cycles and check a balance.

-   [Whoami](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/whoami) is a simple canister that reports the Principal of its caller.

### Intermediate

The intermediate samples demonstrate how to use some of the basic concepts in common use cases. The samples show how to build simple backend functionalities in Motoko.

-   [Calc](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/calc) is a more advanced version of counter demo.

-   [Classes](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/classes) shows a dynamic actor (class) instantiation.

-   [Pub-sub](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/pub-sub) shows multiple canisters, with publisher-subscriber inter-canister calls.

-   [Simple to-do](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/simple-to-do) is a CRUD-like demo service, sans a front end; see also: phone-book and superheroes.


### Minimal frontend

These two samples show how to create simple frontends in JavaScript. Where the previous samples did not provide a frontend, these two samples provide both a frontend and a backend.

-   [Cert\_var](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/cert-var) shows a simple certified variable (a single 32-bit number), with client-side certificate validation.

-   [Random maze](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/random_maze) is a random maze generation, with IC-based randomness.
