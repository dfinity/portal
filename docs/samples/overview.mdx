# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Sample projects"]} />

Take a look at some sample dapps below and see the possibilities of building on ICP. All samples and further projects can be found in the [samples repo](https://github.com/dfinity/examples). Additional resources can be found in the [awesome DFINITY repo](https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-dfinity), a curated set of open-source projects and examples from our community.

## Explore further samples in Motoko

This is a collection of repo-links to additional code samples written in Motoko. Most are also available in the [playground](https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.raw.ic0.app/). Deploying to the playground is ICP's equivalent of deploying to a testnet network. The playground provides the simplest environment for trying out pure Motoko samples without having to download and learn to use the SDK, but does not support dapps with frontends.

### Full stack

These samples demonstrate how to build dapps on ICP, with frontends based on React and TypeScript.

-   [Auth client demo](https://github.com/krpeacock/auth-client-demo) is a simple authentication with Internet Identity.
-   [IC-avatar](https://github.com/krpeacock/ic-avatar) is a full-stack Motoko + React with more advanced authentication, image uploads, and optimistic updates.

### Advanced

Large samples contributed by the community and not necessarily up-to-date:

-   [Certified asset canister](https://github.com/nomeata/motoko-certified-http) and [forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/certified-assets-from-motoko-poc-tutorial/7263) demonstrates a larger application of Internet Computer certified variables.
