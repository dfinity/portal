# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Sample projects"]} />

Take a look at some sample dapps below and see the possibilities of building on ICP. All samples and further projects can be found in the [samples repo](https://github.com/dfinity/examples). Additional resources can be found in the [awesome DFINITY repo](https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-dfinity), a curated set of open-source projects and examples from our community.

## Invoice canister

- [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/invoice-canister).

## Minimal counter dapp

The example dapp shows how to build a very basic dapp with both backend and frontend, using Motoko for the backend functionality and plain HTML and JavaScript for the frontend. The dapp is a simple counter, which will increment a counter by clicking a button in the frontend.

- [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/minimal-counter-dapp).

## NFT minting

This NFT minting dapp showcases how easy it can be to create a user generated NFT and share it. This dapp uses the [DIP721](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DIP721) NFT standard.
- [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/dip721-nft-container).
- [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/1po3udDADp4).

## NFT wallet
This is an NFT wallet example dapp that utilizes minted NFTs from the Rust dip721-nft-container. Among some of its essential features, the wallet can register NFTs, transfer out NFTs and check how many NFTs it contains. This dapp includes a frontend UI for interaction.

- [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/nft-wallet).

## Periodic tasks

- [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/periodic_tasks).

## Persistent storage

The example dapp shows how to build a simple dapp in Motoko, which will have persistent storage. The dapp is a simple counter, which will increment a counter, retrieve the counter value and reset the counter value by calling backend functions. The functions are exposed through a Candid interface.

- [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/persistent-storage).

## Phone book

This simple dapp is a CRUD-like demo service for storing pieces of related information, such as names and phone numbers.

## Point of sale (POS)

This app demonstrates a real world use case for [ckBTC](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/bitcoin/ckbtc/) on the Internet Computer. It is a simple point of sale app that allows users to charge customers using ckBTC. It also demonstrates the [HTTPS outcall](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/https-outcalls/) functionality by sending notifications to users when a payment is received.

- [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/ic-pos).

## Quicksort

This example shows how to sort an array, via quicksort, in Motoko.
- [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/quicksort).

## QR code generator

This example shows that an Internet Computer dapp can perform a long-running computation, like image processing, in a single message execution which is possible due to a unique feature called Deterministic Time Slicing (DTS) that automatically divides long computations into smaller slices executed across multiple blocks.

- [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/qrcode).

## Random maze

This sample shows how to create a simple frontend in JavaScript where the previous samples did not provide a frontend, this sample provides both a frontend and a backend. It creates a random maze generation, with ICP-based randomness.
- [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/random_maze).

## Explore further samples in Motoko

This is a collection of repo-links to additional code samples written in Motoko. Most are also available in the [Motoko playground](https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.raw.ic0.app/). The playground provides the simplest environment for trying out pure Motoko samples without having to download and learn to use the SDK, but does not support dapps with frontends.
