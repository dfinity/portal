# System canisters

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Concept"]} />

System canisters are canisters that provide a necessary function to the ICP network. They are controlled by the NNS and upgraded via NNS proposals. Each system canister is deployed on a system subnet. System subnets have special parameters, such as no cycles costs, to guarantee that the system functions without interruption. These canisters have static canister IDs that projects can make calls to. One common example of a system canister that is used by projects is the Internet Identity canister.

## Bitcoin mainnet

The [Bitcoin mainnet](/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/bitcoin/overview) system canister is used to facilitate connection from the ICP mainnet to the Bitcoin mainnet.

It has canister ID [`ghsi2-tqaaa-aaaan-aaaca-cai`](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ghsi2-tqaaa-aaaan-aaaca-cai).

The Bitcoin mainnet canister is hosted on the system subnet [`w4rem-dv5e3-widiz-wbpea-kbttk-mnzfm-tzrc7-svcj3-kbxyb-zamch-hqe`](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnet/w4rem-dv5e3-widiz-wbpea-kbttk-mnzfm-tzrc7-svcj3-kbxyb-zamch-hqe).

The SNS Wasm canister is hosted on the system subnet [`tdb26-jop6k-aogll-7ltgs-eruif-6kk7m-qpktf-gdiqx-mxtrf-vb5e6-eqe`](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnet/tdb26-jop6k-aogll-7ltgs-eruif-6kk7m-qpktf-gdiqx-mxtrf-vb5e6-eqe).

## Using system canisters

Developers can use system canisters in their projects to integrate services into their dapp or enable functionality that requires data from a system canister.

For example, Internet Identity can be integrated into a dapp to provide user authentication service to the project. Internet Identity is commonly integrated into a dapp through the [`dfx deps`](/docs/building-apps/advanced/using-third-party-canisters) command. `dfx deps` allows you to pull a system canister into your local project for testing.

For other projects, calls can be made to system canisters to obtain information, such as DeFi projects making calls to the ICP index to obtain information about ICP transactions or price.
