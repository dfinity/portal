= Local objects and classes
:proglang: Motoko
:company-id: DFINITY

In {proglang}, an `object` may encapsulate local state (`var`-bound variables) by packaging this state with `public` methods that access and update it.

As in other typed languages, {proglang} programs benefit from the ability to encapsulate state as objects with abstract types.

However, {proglang} objects that include mutable state are _not shareable_, and this is a critical security-oriented design decision.

If they were shareable, that would mean either conceptually moving a mobile object's code among actors and executing it remotely, a security risk, or sharing state with remote logic, another security risk.  (Notably, as a subcase, objects may be pure records and those _are_ shareable, since they are free from mutable state.)

To compensate for this necessary limitation, `actor` objects _are shareable_, but always execute remotely.
They communicate with shareable {proglang} data only.
Local objects interact in less restricted ways with themselves, and can pass any {proglang} data to each other's methods, including other objects.
In most other ways, local objects (and classes) are non-shareable counterparts to actor objects (and classes).

The link:mutable-state{outfilesuffix}[Mutable state] introduced declarations of private mutable state, in the form of `var`-bound variables and (mutable) array allocation.
In this chapter, we use mutable state to implement simple objects, much like how we would implement simple objects in object-oriented programming.

We illustrate this support via a running example, which continues in the next chapter.
The following example illustrates a general evolution path for {proglang} programs.
Each _object_, if important enough, has the potential to be refactored into an Internet _service_, by refactoring this _(local) object_ into an _actor object_.

*Object classes*. Frequently, one needs _a family_ of related objects to perform a task.
When objects exhibit similar behavior, it makes sense to fabricate them according to the same blueprint,
but with customizable initial state.
To this end, {proglang} provides a syntactical construct, called a `class` definition,
which simplifies building objects of the same type and implementation.
We introduce these after discussing objects.

*Actor classes*.
When an object class exposes a _link:actors-async.adoc[service]_ (asynchronous behavior), the corresponding {proglang} construct is an link:actors-async.adoc[actor class], which follows a similar (but distinct) design.


== Example: The `counter` object

Consider the following _object declaration_ of the object value `counter`:

[source, motoko]
....
object counter {
  var count = 0;
  public func inc() { count += 1 };
  public func read() : Nat { count };
  public func bump() : Nat {
    inc();
    read()
  };
};
....

This declaration introduces a single object instance named `counter`, whose entire implementation is given above.

In this example, the developer exposes three _public_ functions `inc`, `read` and `bump` using keyword `public` to declare each in the object body.
The body of the object, like a block expression, consists of a list of declarations.

In addition to these three functions, the object has one (private) mutable variable `count`, which holds the current count, initially zero.

== Object types

This object `counter` has the following _object type_, written as a list of field-type pairs, enclosed in braces (`{` and `}`):

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
{
  inc  : () -> () ;
  read : () -> Nat ;
  bump : () -> Nat ;
}
....

Each field type consists of an identifier, a colon `:`, and a type for the field content.  Here, each field is a function, and thus has an _arrow_ type form (`_ -> _`).

In the declaration of `object`, the variable `count` was explicitly declared neither as `public` nor as `private`.

By default, all declarations in an object block are `private`, as is `count` here.
Consequently, the type for `count` does not appear in the type of the object, _and_ its name and presence are both inaccessible from the outside.

The inaccessibility of this field comes with a powerful benefit:
By not exposing this implementation detail, the object has a _more general_ type (fewer fields), and as a result, is interchangeable with objects that implement the same counter object type differently, without using such a field.

== Example: The `byteCounter` object

To illustrate the point just above, consider this variation of the `counter` declaration above, of `byteCounter`:

[source, motoko]
....
import Nat8 "mo:base/Nat8";
object byteCounter {
  var count : Nat8 = 0;
  public func inc() { count += 1 };
  public func read() : Nat { Nat8.toNat(count) };
  public func bump() : Nat { inc(); read() };
};
....

This object has the same type as the previous one, and thus from the standpoint of type checking, this object is interchangeable with the prior one:

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
{
  inc  : () -> () ;
  read : () -> Nat ;
  bump : () -> Nat ;
}
....

Unlike the first version, however, this version does not use the same implementation of the counter field.
Rather than use an ordinary natural `Nat` that never overflows, but may also grow without bound, this version uses a byte-sized natural number (type `Nat8`) whose size is always eight bits.

As such, the `inc` operation may fail with an overflow for this object, but never the prior one, which may instead (eventually) fill the program's memory, a different kind of application failure.

Neither implementation of a counter comes without some complexity, but in this case, they share a common type.

In general, a common type shared among two implementations (of an object or service) affords the potential for the internal implementation complexity to be factored away from the rest of the application that uses it.
Here, the common type abstracts over the simple choice of a number's representation.
In general, the implementation choices would each be more complex, and more interesting.

== Object subtyping

To illustrate the role and use of object subtyping in {proglang}, consider implementing a simpler counter with a more general type (fewer public operations):

[source, motoko]
....
object bumpCounter {
  var c = 0; 
  public func bump() : Nat { 
    c += 1; 
    c 
  };
};
....

The object `bumpCounter` has the following object type, exposing exactly one operation, `bump`:

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
{ 
  bump : () -> Nat ;
 }
....

This type exposes the most common operation, and one that only permits certain behavior.
For instance, the counter can only ever increase, and can never decrease or be set to an arbitrary value.

In other parts of a system, we may in fact implement and use a _less general_ version, with _more_ operations:

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
fullCounter : {
  inc   : () -> () ;
  read  : () -> Nat ;
  bump  : () -> Nat ;
  write : Nat -> () ;
}
....

Here, we consider a counter named `fullCounter` with a less general type than any given above.
In addition to `inc`, `read` and `bump`, it additionally includes `write`, which permits the caller to change the current count value to an arbitrary one, such as back to `0`.

**Object subtyping.** In {proglang}, objects have types that may
  relate by subtyping, as the various types of counters do above.  As
  is standard, types with _more fields_ are _less general_ (are _**sub**types_
  of) types with _fewer fields_.  For instance, we can summarize the
  types given in the examples above as being related in the following
  subtyping order:

- Most general:

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
{ bump : () -> Nat }
....

- Middle generality:

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
{
  inc  : () -> () ;
  read : () -> Nat ;
  bump : () -> Nat ;
}
....

- Least generality:

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
{
  inc  : () -> () ;
  read : () -> Nat ;
  bump : () -> Nat ;
  write : Nat -> () ;
}
....

If a function expects to receive an object of the first type (`{ bump: () -> Nat }`), _any_ of the types given above will suffice, since they are each equal to, or a subtype of, this (most general) type.

However, if a function expects to receive an object of the last, least general type, the other two will _not_ suffice, since they each lack the needed `write` operation, to which this function rightfully expects to have access.

== Object classes

In {proglang}, an object encapsulates state, and an object `class` is
a package of two entities that share a common name.

Consider this example `class` for counters that start at zero:

[source#counter, motoko]
....
class Counter() {
  var c = 0;
  public func inc() : Nat {
    c += 1;
    return c;
  }
};
....

The value of this definition is that we can _construct_ new counters,
each starting with their own unique state, initially at zero:

[source#cinit.include_counter, motoko]
....
let c1 = Counter();
let c2 = Counter();
....

Each is independent:

[source.include_counter_cinit, motoko]
....
let x = c1.inc();
let y = c2.inc();
(x, y)
....

We could achieve the same results by writing a function that returns an object:

[source, motoko]
....
func Counter() : { inc : () -> Nat } =
  object {
    var c = 0;
    public func inc() : Nat { c += 1; c }
  };
....

Notice the return type of this _constructor function_ (an object type):

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
{ inc : () -> Nat }
....

We may want to name this type, for example, `Counter`, as follows, for use in further type declarations:

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
type Counter = { inc : () -> Nat };
....

In fact, the `class` keyword syntax shown above is nothing but a shorthand for these two definitions for `Counter`: a factory function `Counter` that constructs objects, and the type `Counter` of these objects. Classes do not provide any new functionality beyond this convenience.

=== Class constructor

An object class defines a constructor function that may carry zero or more data arguments and zero or more type arguments.

The `Counter` example above has zero of each.

The type arguments, if any, parameterize both the type and the constructor function for the class.

The data arguments, if any, parameterize (only) the constructor function for the class.

==== Data arguments

Suppose we want to initialize the counter with some non-zero value.  We can supply that value as a data argument to the `class` constructor:

[source, motoko]
....
class Counter(init : Nat) {
  var c = init;
  public func inc() : Nat { c += 1; c };
};
....

This parameter is available to all methods.

For instance, we can `reset` the `Counter` to its initial value, a parameter:

[source, motoko]
....
class Counter(init : Nat) {
  var c = init;
  public func inc() : Nat { c += 1; c };
  public func reset() { c := init };
};
....

==== Type arguments

Suppose we want the counter to actually carry data that it counts (like a specialized `Buffer`).

When classes use or contain data of arbitrary type, they carry a type
argument (or equivalently, _type parameter_) for that unknown type, just as with functions.

The scope of this type parameter covers the entire `class`, just as with data parameters.
As such, the methods of the class can use (and _need not re-introduce_) these type parameters.

[source, motoko]
....
import Buffer "mo:base/Buffer";

class Counter<X>(init : Buffer.Buffer<X>) {
  var buffer = init.clone();
  public func add(x : X) : Nat { 
    buffer.add(x); 
    buffer.size() 
  };
  
  public func reset() { 
    buffer := init.clone() 
  };
};
....

==== Type annotation

Optionally, the class constructor may also carry a type annotation for its "return type" (the type of objects that it produces).
When supplied, {proglang} checks that this type annotation is compatible with the body of the class (an object definition).
This check ensures that each object produced by the constructor meets the supplied specification.

For example, we repeat the `Counter` as a buffer, and annotate it with
a more general type `Accum<X>` that permits adding, but not resetting
the counter. This annotation ensures that the objects are compatible
with the type `Accum<X>`.

[source, motoko]
....
import Buffer "mo:base/Buffer";

type Accum<X> = { add : X -> Nat };

class Counter<X>(init : Buffer.Buffer<X>) : Accum<X> {
  var buffer = init.clone();
  public func add(x : X) : Nat { buffer.add(x); buffer.size() };
  public func reset() { buffer := init.clone() };
};
....

==== Full syntax

In full, classes are defined by the keyword `class`, followed by:
 - a name for the constructor and type being defined (for example, `Counter`)
 - optional type arguments (for example, omitted, or `<X>`, or `<X, Y>`)
 - an argument list (for example, `()`, or `(init : Nat)`, etc.)
 - an optional type annotation for the constructed objects (for example, omitted, or `Accum<X>`),
 - the class "body" is an object definition, parameterized by the type and value arguments (if any).

The constituents of the body marked `public` contribute to the resulting objects' type and these types compared against the (optional) annotation, if given.

=====  Another example: `Bits`

As another example, let's consider the task of walking the bits of a natural number (type `Nat`). For this example, we could define the following:

[source, motoko]
....
class Bits(n : Nat) {
  var state = n;
  public func next() : ?Bool {
    if (state == 0) { return null };
    let prev = state;
    state /= 2;
    ?(state * 2 != prev)
  }
}
....

The above class definition is equivalent to the simultaneous definition of a structural type synonym and a factory function, both named `Bits`:

[source, motoko]
....
type Bits = {next : () -> ?Bool}
let Bits : Nat -> Bits =
func Bits(n : Nat) : Bits = object {
  // class body
};
....

== Structural subtyping

Object subtyping in {proglang} uses _structural subtyping_, not _nominal subtyping_.

Recall that in nominal typing, the question of two types equality depends on choosing consistent, globally-unique type names (across projects and time).

In {proglang}, the question of two types' equality is based on their _structure_, not their names.

Due to structural typing, naming the class type provides a convenient abbreviation.

For typing purposes, however, all that matters is the _structure_ of the corresponding object type: two classes with different names but equivalent definitions produce type-compatible objects.

When the optional type annotation is supplied in a class declaration, conformance is checked: the object type must be a subtype of the annotation. The annotation does not affect the type of the class, however, even if it only describes a proper super-type of the object type.

Formally, subtyping relationships in {proglang} extend to all types, not just object types.

Most cases are standard, and follow conventional programming language theory (for _structural_ subtyping, specifically).

Other notable cases in {proglang} for new programmers include
array, options, variants and number type inter-relationships.
