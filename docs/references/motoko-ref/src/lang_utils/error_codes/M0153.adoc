= M0153

This error means that an imported Candid file (`.did`) mentions types that
cannot be represented in Motoko. These are

 * `float32`
 * `service` types with method names that are not identifiers, e.g. because
   they contain special characters.

If you encounter this error, and you can, you should avoid these types in the
serviceâ€™s interface. If you have no control over the interface, you cannot
interact with it from Motoko.
