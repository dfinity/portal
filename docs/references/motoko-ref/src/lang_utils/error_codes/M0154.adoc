You are using a field (typically a module field) that has a deprecation annotation
attached to its definition, e.g.

  module SomeModule {

    /// @deprecated The foo function is deprecated and will be removed next release
    public func foo() {}

  }

The warning should include an explanation provided by the author of that code.
