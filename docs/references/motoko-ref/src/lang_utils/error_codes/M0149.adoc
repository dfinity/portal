= M0149

This error means that you supplied a immutable record field (declared without `var`), where a mutable record field (specified with `var`), was expected.

Erroneous code example:

  { count = 0 } : { var count : Nat }


If you encounter this error, you should probably insert the `var` keyword:


  { var count = 1 } : { var count : Nat }
