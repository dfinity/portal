(*
The kind field is a reference to break the recursion in open_binds,
and to allow the multiple passes in typing. These go through Type.set_kind
with additional safeguards.

Besides these two use-cases, the kind should not be mutated, and treated like
immutable data.

This module interface guarantees that constructors with the same stamp have the
same ref.
