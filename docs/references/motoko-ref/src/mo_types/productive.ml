open Type

(*
  Maintain a map from con to info = {Nonproductive, Productive, Param n}`.
  After the analysis, this map says, for all type constructors, whether they are  really unproductive, productive, or if their unfolding is equal to one of their parameters.
* Maintain a set of type definitions under scrutiny
* For each type definition:
  * If it is already in the memo map, use that result. Else analyze it as follows, updating the memo map afterwards.
  * If it is already in the set, we have found a loop. Mark it as `unproductive`. Else add to the setduring the next step.
  * Consider its RHS:
    * If it is a concrete type, return `Productive`.
    * If it is the nth type parameter, return `Param n`
    * If it is a type application `T<t1,…,tn>`, recurse.
      * If recursion returns `Productive` or `Nonproductive`, return that.
      * If recursion returns `Param n`, loop to “Consider its RHS”, as if `tn`
        is the RHS.
