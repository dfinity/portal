# Using the ICP dashboard

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

The ICP dashboard is a graphical interface used to display real-time data about different aspects of the Internet Computer network. It can be accessed at https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/, or you can query data from your application through various different [API endpoints](dashboard-apis.mdx).
