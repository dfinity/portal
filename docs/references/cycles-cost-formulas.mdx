# Cycles cost formulas

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

Canisters are charged for the resources they consume and any operations they perform using features such as HTTPS outcalls, threshold signatures, and the Bitcoin integration API. At a high level this can be visualized using the following diagram:

The cost of cycles is pegged to the value of [XDR](/docs/references/glossary#x) (Special Drawing Rights). Specifically, 1 trillion cycles = 1 XDR. As of May 22, 2025**, the exchange rate of XDR is 1 XDR = $1.354820 USD. However, this rate may fluctuate over time. For the latest rates, see the [IMFâ€™s official XDR exchange data](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx).

The following table shows units of cycles and the respective fiat values:

| Abbreviation | Name      | In numbers         | Cycles XDR value | Cycles USD value       |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| T            | Trillion  | 1_000_000_000_000  | 1                | 1.354820                |

## Cost calculation formulas

A detailed, mathematical example of how the cost of running a canister on a 13-node subnet is computed can be found [on the wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Comparing_Canister_Cycles_vs_Performance_Counter).

Specific mathematical formulas used to calculate various costs are provided below for reference.

### Message transmissions

A fixed baseline fee and per-byte fee are charged for each byte of the message: `base-fee` + `per-byte-fee` * `size-in-bytes`.

### Execution

The execution cost consists of a fixed execution fee and a per-instruction fee (on application subnets (13 nodes), 1 instruction costs 1 cycle) that is charged for each executed WebAssembly instruction:

`base-fee` + `per-instruction-fee` * `number-of-instructions`

The current values of fees are `base-fee` = 5M cycles (or $0.0000067741 USD), `per-instruction-fee` = 1 cycle (or $0.000541928 USD for 1B instructions).

### HTTPS outcalls

The cycles cost of an HTTPS outcall request has both a fixed and variable component. The fixed component accounts for the known overhead associated with an HTTPS outcall, whereas the variable component accounts for the resources consumed during the request.

The cost scales with regard to subnet size, **where `n` is the number of nodes on the subnet.**

Currently, these fees are:

```
total_fee = base_fee + size_fee
base_fee = (3_000_000 + 60_000 * n) * n
size_fee = (400 * request_bytes + 800 * max_response_bytes) * n
```

The `request_bytes` includes the entire request, not just the HTTP body:

```
request_size = url.len + transform.name.len + transform.context.len + body.len + header_len
header_len = header_1.name + header_1.value + ... + header_n.name + header_n.value
```

`max_response_bytes` is either set by the canister or defaults to `2M`.

## Cycles price breakdown

The table below details the cost of compute, storage transmissions, and canister calls.

You can use the [pricing calculator](https://3d5wy-5aaaa-aaaag-qkhsq-cai.icp0.io/) to estimate the cost for your dapp.
