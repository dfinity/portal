# Reference documentation

## Overview

In this category you will find reference documentation for various components of the Internet Computer. This is the place to come if you wanted to know the signature for a particular method, or which functions are offered in an SDK, or, if you are so inclined, simply to browse and get a better picture of the components that make up the Internet Computer.

## SDK references
The DFINITY command-line execution environment (dfx) is the primary tool for creating, deploying, and managing the dapps for the Internet Computer platform.

- Explore the IC SDK and its subcommands in the [dfx commands and envars](cli-reference/index.md) section.
- Check the [dfx.json](dfx-json-reference.md) schema. 
  
## Language references
Motoko and Rust are two of the better supported languages for building on the IC. You can quickly access all their functionality by exploring:
- The [Motoko references](../motoko/main/base//index.md).
- The [Rust references](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/). 
- A major ingredient in allowing data exchange across the IC is a language independent description of the canister interfaces called Candid. You can see the functional description by exploring the [Candid references](candid-ref.md).

## Functionality references
Now that more dapps are being built on the IC, it becomes apparent that several functionalities will be required by many or most apps. As such, several functionalities have been designed and developed. 
- To learn more about financial integration explore the [ledger canister](ledger.md). 
- To reference authentication and identity services see the [Internet Identity specification](ii-spec.md). 

## Internet Computer references
For those who want to understand the intricacies of the Internet Computerâ€™s behavior in detail, we refer you to the [Internet Computer interface specification](ic-interface-spec.md).

## Security best practices
We also include here various suggestions for [security best practices](../developer-docs/security/index.md). There is information useful for developing with a security mindset when building on the IC, but also more generally.
