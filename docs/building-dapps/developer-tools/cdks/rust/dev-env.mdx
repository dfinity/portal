# Developer environment

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Rust" ]} />

## Setting up your environment

Before you start your project, verify the following:

- [x] You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.

- [x] You have a command line interface (CLI) window open. This window is also referred to as the 'terminal' window.

- [x] You have installed [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

- [x] You have downloaded and installed the Rust programming language and Cargo as described in the [Rust installation instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) for your operating system.

    ``` bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```

- [x] You have installed the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:

    ``` bash
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```

- [x]  You have downloaded and installed the IC SDK package as described in the [installing the IC SDK](/docs/current/building-dapps/getting-started/install) page.

    To support Rust development, the IC SDK includes the [Rust canister development kit (Rust CDK)](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs).

    **While using the IC SDK is the typical path for most developers, experienced Rust developers may choose to circumvent IC SDK entirely and use the [Rust CDK](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs) directly.**

- [x] You have a code editor installed. The [VS Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is a popular choice for Rust.

- [x] You have downloaded and installed [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- [x] Assure that all packages and tools above are updated to the latest release versions.

## Next steps

After following the steps above, you're ready to get started developing backend canisters with Rust!
