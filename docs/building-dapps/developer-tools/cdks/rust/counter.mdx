# Canister state

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Rust", "Tutorial"]} />



In this guide, you are going to write a dapp that provides a few basic functions to increment a counter value. by calling functions on a deployed canister. By calling the function to increment a value multiple times, you can verify that the variable state, that is, the value of the variable between calls, persists.

For this guide, the dapp declares a `COUNTER` as a mutable variable to contain a natural number that represents the current value of the counter. This dapp supports the following functions:

-   The `increment` function updates the current value, incrementing by 1 with no return value.

-   The `get` function is a simple query that returns the current value of the counter.

-   The `set` function updates the current value to the numeric value you specify as an argument.


## Prerequisites

Before getting started, assure you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in the [developer environment guide](./dev-env.mdx).

## Create the counter dapp project

Open a terminal window on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.

Start by creating a new project by running the following command:

Use `dfx new <project_name> --type=rust` to create a new project:

```bash
dfx start --clean --background
dfx new rust_counter --type=rust
```

Then, navigate into your project directory by running the command:

``` bash
cd rust_counter
```

Now that you have the files in place for your Rust dapp, you can replace the template `lib.rs` dapp code with some code that creates a counter dapp instead.

To replace the default dapp, open the template `src/rust_counter_backend/src/lib.rs` file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Then, copy and paste this code into the file:

```rust title="src/rust_counter_backend/src/lib.rs"
use candid::types::number::Nat;
use ic_cdk::{query, update};
use std::cell::RefCell;

thread_local! {
    static COUNTER: RefCell<Nat> = RefCell::new(Nat::from(0 as u32));
}

/// Get the value of the counter.
#[query]
fn get() -> Nat {
    COUNTER.with(|counter| counter.borrow().clone())
}

/// Set the value of the counter.
#[update]
fn set(n: Nat) {
    COUNTER.with(|counter| *counter.borrow_mut() = n);
}

#[update]
fn increment() {
    COUNTER.with(|counter| *counter.borrow_mut() += 1 as u32);
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_get_set() {
        let expected = Nat::from(42 as u32);
        set(expected.clone());
        assert_eq!(get(), expected);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_init() {
        assert_eq!(get(), Nat::from(0 as u32));
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_inc() {
        for i in 1..10 {
            increment();
            assert_eq!(get(), Nat::from(i as u32));
        }
    }
}
```

Save your changes and close the file to continue.

### Update interface description file

Candid is an interface description language (IDL) for interacting with canisters running on ICP. To see details about the Candid interface description language syntax, see the [Candid guide](/docs/current/building-dapps/interacting-with-dapps/candid/candid-concepts) or the [Candid crate documentation](https://docs.rs/candid/).

To update the Candid file, open the `src/rust_counter_backend/rust_counter_backend.did` file in a text editor, then copy and paste the following `service` definition for the `increment`, `get`, and `set` functions:

``` did title="src/rust_counter_backend/rust_counter_backend.did"
service : {
    "increment": () -> ();
    "get": () -> (nat) query;
    "set": (nat) -> ();
}
```

Save your changes and close the `rust_counter_backend.did` file to continue.

## Writing the Cargo.toml file

As with any standard Rust crate, it has a `Cargo.toml` file which configures the details to build the Rust crate.

Open the `src/rust_counter_backend/Cargo.toml` file and replace the existing content with the following:

``` toml title="src/rust_counter_backend/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "rust_counter_backend"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
candid = "0.10"
ic-cdk = "0.13"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
ic-cdk-macros = "0.8.0"
```

Save the file.

## Update the Cargo.toml dependencies

Since you made changes to the Cargo.toml file, run the following command to update the project's dependencies:

```bash
cargo update
```

### Register, build, and deploy your project

Register, build, and deploy the canisters specified in the `dfx.json` file by running the following command:

``` bash
dfx deploy
```

## Call the canister's functions and test the dapp

After successfully deploying the canister, you can test it by invoking the functions it provides. For this guide:

-   Call the `get` function to query the value of the counter.

-   Call the `increment` function to increment the counter each time it is called.

-   Call the `set` function to pass an argument to update the counter to an arbitrary value you specify.

Call the `get` function to read the current value of the `COUNTER` variable by running the following command:

``` bash
dfx canister call rust_counter_backend get
```

The command returns the current value of the `COUNTER` variable as zero:

```
(0 : nat)
```

Call the `increment` function to increment the value of the `COUNTER` variable by one:

``` bash
dfx canister call rust_counter_backend increment
```

This command increments the value of the variable—changing its state—but does not return the result.

Rerun the command to call the `get` function to see the current value of the `COUNTER` variable:

``` bash
dfx canister call rust_counter_backend get
```

The command returns the updated value of the `COUNTER` variable as one:

```
(1 : nat)
```

Run additional commands to experiment with calling the functions and using different values.

For example, try commands similar to the following to set and return the counter value:

``` bash
dfx canister call rust_counter_backend set '(987)'
dfx canister call rust_counter_backend get
```

Returns the current value of 987.

``` bash
dfx canister call rust_counter_backend increment
dfx canister call rust_counter_backend get
```

Returns the incremented value of 988.
