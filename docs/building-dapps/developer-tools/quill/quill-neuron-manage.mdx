## Examples

The `quill neuron-manage` command has many uses, each operating on a neuron in a different way. The examples below will all operate on a hypothetical neuron 2313380519530470538.

To vote YES on a proposal such as [108005]:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --register-vote 108005
```

Or to vote NO on that same proposal:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --register-vote 108005 --reject
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            RegisterVote = record {}
        };
    }
)
```

To follow another neuron, such as ICPMN, on a specific topic, such as Governance:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --follow-neurons 4966884161088437903 --follow-topic 4
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            Follow = record {}
        };
    }
)
```

To stake a neuron's maturity, for example 25% of it, increasing its voting power:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --stake-maturity 25
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            StakeMaturity = record {
                maturity_e8s = 750_000_000 : nat64;
                staked_maturity_e8s = 250_000_000 : nat64;
            }
        };
    }
)
```

"e8s" is a shorthand for meaning the number of 1e-8s, or one-hundred-millionths, of an ICP in integer form; this response must be divided by 100,000,000 to get the real maturity, which in this case would be 7.5 and 2.5.

To disburse a fully dissolved neuron, meaning to convert it into ICP and transfer it to its controller:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --disburse
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            Disburse = record {
                transfer_block_height = 5_581_035 : nat64;
            }
        };
    }
)
```

The block height, also known as the block index, can be looked up on the [IC dashboard].

To spawn a new neuron, meaning to convert all the maturity from this neuron into a new one (that can be disbursed after one week):

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --spawn
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            SpawnResponse = record {
                created_neuron_id = opt record {
                    id = 4966884161088437902 : nat64;
                };
            }
        };
    }
)
``` 

To increase the neuron's dissolve delay, for example by a full year:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538--additional-dissolve-delay-seconds 31536000
```

To start dissolving a neuron:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --start-dissolving
```

Or to stop:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --stop-dissolving
```

To enable auto-staking a neuron's maturity:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --auto-stake-maturity enabled
```

Or to disable:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --auto-stake-maturity disabled
```

To join the IC's community fund:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --join-community-fund
```

Or to leave:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --leave-community-fund
```

To add a neuron hotkey, such as (for example purposes) the management canister:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --add-hot-key aaaaa-aa
```

Or to remove it:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --remove-hot-key aaaaa-aa
```

These 'configuration' operations will all produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            Configure = record {}
        };
    }
)
```

## Remarks

As this is an update call, it will not actually make the request, but rather generate a signed and packaged request that can be sent from anywhere. You can use the `--qr` flag to display it as a QR code, or if you are not working with an air-gapped machine, you can pipe it to `quill send -`.
