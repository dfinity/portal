# Ecosystem promotional resources

The DFINITY Foundation appreciates each contribution to the ICP ecosystem and provides resources to community developers to help promote their project through social media and other public promotional channels.

To request promotion assistance from DFINITY, you will need to provide:

1. A product pitch video.

2. X (formerly Twitter) support.

3. Submit your project to our Ecosystem showcase.

## Product pitch video

A product pitch video enables DFINITY, PR, and marketing teams to get an overview of your project's core value proposition in a quick and effective manner. A pitch video is also helpful to the community, as it shows them what you're building and can help encourage organic user traffic and adoption. 

### Creating a pitch video

A pitch video should be between 4 and 6 minutes in length on a public video platform like YouTube. Be sure that the visibility of the video is set to Public.

To produce the video, split the content into two parts: a general introduction and a code or architecture walkthrough.

#### General introduction (2-3 minutes)

Assume that your audience is completely unfamiliar with what you are building. After they watch the 2 - 3 minute introduction, they should be able to speak about your project's key value proposition. Some questions that you may want to cover include:

- [] Introduce the team, the project's name, and marketing tagline if you have one.

- [] Who are the target users?

- [] What problem or use case does your project solve?

    - [] Why does this problem exist, or why is this use case valuable?

    - [] What is the potential opportunity for solving this problem? What will it mean for the users of your product?

- [] Why did you choose to build on ICP?

- [] Provide a brief walkthrough or demo of the end-user experience.

#### Code or architecture walkthrough

The second half of the pitch video should provide detailed insight into your codebase and product's architecture. Any technical user or other developer should benefit from this portion of the video and easily make a decision on if they are able to leverage what you're building for their own purposes.

In this portion, you could describe how you built the project and demonstrate a quick code walkthrough.

### Promoting your pitch video

Once your video has been created and uploaded to a public video platform, post it on your X (formerly Twitter) account and share the link with DFINITY via the [ecosystem form](https://airtable.com/appBKNYn6DaFccnno/shrcqNYajcmCnD1rw). In your X post, you should include:

- A description of the product.

- How and why you're building on ICP.

- Include the hashtags #ICP #ICPgrant and #InternetComputer

- Tag @DFINITY and @DFINITYDev

To effectively promote your product to the ICP community, it is highly recommended that you also create a [developer forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/c/developers/).

## Social media (X) support

To receive social media support and promotion from DFINITY, you must fill out the social media & PR request form. This helps the team share exciting and newsworthy announcements on your behalf with the DFINITY social media, PR, and marketing teams.

In the social media request form, you will need to make an X post on your product's account. It could be the post with your pitch video, or it could be another post. Regardless, it will need to contain:

In your X post, you should include:

- A description of the product.

- How and why you're building on ICP.

- Include the hashtags #ICP #ICPgrant and #InternetComputer

- Tag @DFINITY and @DFINITYDev
