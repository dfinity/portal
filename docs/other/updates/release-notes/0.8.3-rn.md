# Highlights of whatâ€™s new in 0.8.3

An overview of the 0.8.3 release:

Breaking change: Removed `--no-artificial-delay` option from `dfx start` and `dfx replica`

## Changes to DFX

### Breaking change: Replaced `--no-artificial-delay` option with a sensible default

The `--no-artificial-delay` option not being the default has been causing a lot of confusion. Now that we have measured in production and already applied a default of 600ms to most subnets deployed, we set the same default for dfx and removed this option.

## Changes to Replica

### Fixed: ic-ref linux binary no longer references /nix/store

This means `dfx start --emulator` has a chance of working on linux if nix is not installed. This has always been broken, even before dfx 0.7.0.

### Fixed: replica and ic-starter linux binaries no longer reference /nix/store

This means `dfx start` will work again on linux. This bug was introduced in dfx 0.8.2.

## Changes to Motoko

Updated Motoko from 0.6.10 to 0.6.11

-   Assertion error messages are now reproducible (#2821)
