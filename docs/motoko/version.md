# Motoko Version

The release of Motoko documented here, currently 0.11.1, may be a few versions
ahead of the Motoko compiler that is shipped with dfx.

You can, however, instruct `dfx` to use a newer version of Motoko than the one
it shipped with.

Consult the
[forum for vessel](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-deploy-with-custom-motoko-version/7665)
or the [mops documentation](https://docs.mops.one/cli/toolchain) for details.
