# Motoko Version

The release of Motoko documented here, currently 0.9.3, may be a few versions ahead of the Motoko compiler that is shipped with dfx.

You can, however, instruct `dfx` to use a newer version of Motoko than the one it shipped with.

Consult the forum for details (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-deploy-with-custom-motoko-version/7665).
