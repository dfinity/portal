# Stable memory and regions

<!---The small code blocks in this these snippets build upon each other, it might be useful to have a single program run in the backend to eliminate unbound errors-->

<!---This section could also benefit from illustrations but i'm not sure what md will allow-->

Canisters have two types of storage: Wasm memory and stable memory. The Wasm memory is often referred to as the [heap memory](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/canister-management/storage#heap-memory). It is automatically used for heap-allocated objects and has a maximum size limitation of 4 GiB. Both 32-bit and 64-bit heap storage are supported. When a canister is upgraded, the heap memory is cleared.

Stable memory has a maximum size limitation of 500 GiB and is preserved across canister upgrades. Motoko utilizes [stable memory](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/canister-management/storage#stable-memory) through the [stable storage feature](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/canister-management/storage#motoko-storage-handling) to preserve data across canister upgrades. Stable regions extend this functionality to allow more structured and flexible memory management.

The system automatically commits all memory modifications, both Wasm and stable, after the successful execution of a message. If a message execution fails, the changes are not committed.

## What is a `Region`?

A [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) is an isolated chunk of stable memory that can be allocated, grown, and managed independently. It functions like a dedicated section of storage, ensuring that its contents remain separate and inaccessible to other parts of the program.

Each [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) has a starting address, a current size, and can grow dynamically. One could think of a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) similarly to an array, where each position corresponds to an index and data is accessed through byte offsets. However, unlike a traditional array, memory management within a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) is manual, requiring explicit tracking of space usage and current position to ensure accurate data access and storage.

### Pages

A **page** is the fundamental unit of allocation in stable memory, serving as the building block for memory management. Each page has a fixed size of 64 KiB (`65_536` bytes) and is zero-initialized upon allocation, ensuring a clean state before use. Pages are accessed using [byte offsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_(computer_science)) for precise control over memory operations.

### Blocks

A **block** is the physical allocation unit used by the ICP runtime system to manage stable memory. Each block consists of 128 stable memory pages, effectively grouping allocations into larger chunks. While memory can be allocated at the page level, the system internally allocates at the block level, meaning memory is reserved in increments of 128 pages. This approach optimizes resource management and reduces fragmentation while maintaining the flexibility of page-level access.

### Position and offsets

An **offset** represents a specific byte position within a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region), starting from `0`. It is used to locate data within the allocated memory space. Positions within a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) are calculated using `current_position + bytes_used`, ensuring proper tracking of where new data should be written or read.

Since stable memory does not inherently manage layout, it is the developerâ€™s responsibility to keep track of what data is stored at each offset.

## Using a `Region`

It is the developer's responsibility to properly manipulate and interpret the data within a regions structure, which may be error-prone. However, the safety of Motoko's native value heap objects is always guaranteed, independent of the stable [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) content. The cost of accessing stable regions is significantly higher than using Motoko's native memory.

### Creation and allocation

A new [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) is created using `Region.new()`, initializing it with a size of 0 pages. The current size can be checked with `Region.size(myRegion)`, which returns the number of allocated pages. To expand the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region), use `Region.grow(myRegion, X)`, where `X` is the number of pages to be added. The function will return the previous size before expansion, allowing verification of successful growth. If the operation fails due to memory constraints, it will return `0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF`, indicating that no additional memory could be allocated.

```motoko no-repl
// Create a new region of initial size 0
let myRegion = Region.new();

// Check the current size (in pages)
let currentSizeInPages = Region.size(myRegion);  // Initially 0

// Grow the region by adding pages
// Returns previous size on success, returns 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF on failure
let previousSize = Region.grow(myRegion, 10);  // Add 10 pages (640 KiB)
```

### Growing a `Region` safely

`Regions` can only grow, never shrink. Growth may fail due to [ICP resource limitations](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/canister-management/resource-limits) and it is recommended to use the minimum pages needed to conserve resources.

Growing a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) safely requires checking the current allocated size and ensuring that the required space does not exceed available capacity. Since stable memory is allocated in fixed-size pages of 64 KiB, any expansion must be done in page increments. To determine how many additional pages are needed, the difference between the required memory and the current capacity is calculated and rounded up to the nearest page boundary. Once the necessary pages are determined, the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) is expanded accordingly. After growth, verifying that the expansion was successful ensures stability and prevents unintended memory access issues.

```motoko no-repl
 // Helper function to ensure a region has enough space
func ensureCapacity(r : Region, requiredBytes : Nat64) {
  let currentPages = Region.size(r);
  let bytesPerPage : Nat64 = 65536;
  let currentCapacity = currentPages * bytesPerPage;
  
  if (requiredBytes > currentCapacity) {
    // Calculate how many new pages we need
    let additionalBytesNeeded = requiredBytes - currentCapacity;
    let pagesNeeded = (additionalBytesNeeded + bytesPerPage - 1) / bytesPerPage;
    
    // Grow the region and check the result
    let result = Region.grow(r, pagesNeeded);
    assert result == currentPages; // Verify growth succeeded
  };
}
```

### Reading and writing data

Since stable memory does not inherently manage data structure layouts, offsets must be tracked manually to ensure correct placement and retrieval of values.

Smaller data types, such as an 8-bit naturals ([`Nat8`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Nat8)), can be written and retrieved from a designated offset. The chosen offset determines where in the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) the value is stored.

```motoko no-repl
// Store an 8-bit value at offset 0
Region.storeNat8(myRegion, 0, 42);

// Read the 8-bit value from offset 0
let value = Region.loadNat8(myRegion, 0);  // Returns 42
```

Larger values, such as [`Nat64`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Nat64), require multiple bytes for storage. Allocating offsets with enough space prevents overlapping data.

In this example, the 64-bit integer is stored at offset `100` to ensure it has sufficient space.

```motoko no-repl
// Store a 64-bit value at offset 100
Region.storeNat64(myRegion, 100, 123456789);

// Read the 64-bit value from offset 100
let longValue = Region.loadNat64(myRegion, 100);  // Returns 123456789
```

Floating-point numbers can also be stored in a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region). Since these values occupy multiple bytes, offsets should be spaced accordingly to avoid overwriting adjacent data.

```motoko no-repl
// Store a floating-point value at offset 200
Region.storeFloat(myRegion, 200, 3.14159);

// Read the floating-point value from offset 200
let pi = Region.loadFloat(myRegion, 200);  // Returns 3.14159
```

regions can be used for storing and retrieving binary data as `Blob`s. This is useful for handling arbitrary sequences of bytes, such as serialized objects or encoded information.

`Blob`s can be stored at any offset, but their size must be considered when choosing a starting position. Retrieving the correct number of bytes ensures that data integrity is maintained when working with binary storage in a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region).

```motoko no-repl
// Create a blob
let myData = Blob.fromArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// Store the blob at offset 300
Region.storeBlob(myRegion, 300, myData);

// Read 5 bytes from offset 300
let retrievedData = Region.loadBlob(myRegion, 300, 5);  // Returns the same blob
```

### Mops packages for Regions

- [`memory-region`](https://mops.one/memory-region]): A library for abstraction over the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) type that supports reusing deallocated memory.

- [`stable-enum`](https://mops.one/stable-enum): Enumerations implemented in stable regions.

- [`stable-buffer`](https://mops.one/stable-buffer): Buffers implemented in stable regions.


## Memory layout strategies for using regions

While the basic operations above demonstrate how to store and retrieve individual values in a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region), real-world applications typically require more organized approaches to memory management. The following memory layout strategies build upon these fundamental operations to create structured patterns for data organization. These strategies provide systematic ways to allocate, track, and access data within regions, allowing developers to implement more complex data structures while maintaining efficient memory usage.

Each strategy offers different trade-offs between simplicity, flexibility, and performance depending on your application's specific requirements.

### Sequential

In sequential storage, data is written one after the other, and you must track the next available position to prevent overwriting. This approach appends new data to the end of the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region), recording its size before the actual content.

```motoko no-repl
var nextPosition : Nat64 = 0;

// Store a series of values sequentially
func storeSequential(value : Blob) : Nat64 {
  let position = nextPosition;
  let size = Nat64.fromNat(value.size());
  
  // Store the size followed by the data
  Region.storeNat64(myRegion, position, size);
  Region.storeBlob(myRegion, position + 8, value);
  
  // Update the next available position
  nextPosition := position + 8 + size;
  
  // Return the position where we stored the data
  position
}
```

### Fixed-size entry

Fixed-size storage divides memory into uniformly sized slots, making it easier to access entries at predictable positions using `index * ENTRY_SIZE`. This method simplifies retrieval but may waste space if entries contain less data than the allocated size.

```motoko no-repl
let ENTRY_SIZE : Nat64 = 100;  // Each entry is 100 bytes

// Store in a specific entry slot
func storeEntry(index : Nat64, data : Blob) {
  assert Nat64.fromNat(data.size()) <= ENTRY_SIZE;
  
  let position = index * ENTRY_SIZE;
  Region.storeBlob(myRegion, position, data);
}

// Read from a specific entry slot
func readEntry(index : Nat64, size : Nat) : Blob {
  let position = index * ENTRY_SIZE;
  Region.loadBlob(myRegion, position, size)
}
```

### Index-based

For variable-sized data, an index [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) is used to track where each entry is stored within a separate data [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region). This method maintains two separate memory regions: one for **indexes** that store positions and sizes and one for **actual data**. Using an index allows efficient access to variable-length data while avoiding fragmentation issues.

```motoko no-repl
// Two regions: one for index, one for data
let indexRegion = Region.new();
let dataRegion = Region.new();
var dataPosition : Nat64 = 0;

// Store data and update index
func storeWithIndex(index : Nat64, data : Blob) {
  let size = Nat64.fromNat(data.size());
  
  // Store position and size in the index
  Region.storeNat64(indexRegion, index * 16, dataPosition);
  Region.storeNat64(indexRegion, index * 16 + 8, size);
  
  // Store actual data
  Region.storeBlob(dataRegion, dataPosition, data);
  
  // Update next data position
  dataPosition += size;
}

// Retrieve data using index
func retrieveByIndex(index : Nat64) : Blob {
  let position = Region.loadNat64(indexRegion, index * 16);
  let size = Region.loadNat64(indexRegion, index * 16 + 8);
  
  Region.loadBlob(dataRegion, position, Nat64.toNat(size))
}
```

## Best practices

Managing stable memory effectively requires structuring data in a way that ensures compatibility, scalability, and reliability. It is best practice to use versioning, metadata headers, and transaction logs to help maintain a well-organized memory layout.

### Versioning data

Including a version marker at the beginning of a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) ensures compatibility across different data formats and future upgrades. This approach ensures that older versions of the stored data remain accessible while allowing new formats to be introduced. The version marker, typically stored at offset `0`, is checked before performing any operations.

```motoko no-repl
// When initializing a region
if (Region.size(myRegion) == 0) {
  // Initialize with version 1
  Region.grow(myRegion, 1);
  Region.storeNat64(myRegion, 0, 1);
}

// When reading, check version
let version = Region.loadNat64(myRegion, 0);
if (version == 1) {
  // Handle version 1 data format
} else if (version == 2) {
  // Handle version 2 data format
}
```

### Metadata header

A metadata header at the beginning of a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) allows efficient tracking of data version, entry count, and available space. This structure provides a centralized reference for managing stored data, preventing unnecessary scanning of the entire [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) to determine its state.

```motoko no-repl
// Metadata structure:
// Offset 0: Version (8 bytes)
// Offset 8: Entry count (8 bytes)
// Offset 16: Next available position (8 bytes)
// Offset 24: Data starts here

// Update metadata
func updateMetadata(version : Nat64, count : Nat64, position : Nat64) {
  Region.storeNat64(myRegion, 0, version);
  Region.storeNat64(myRegion, 8, count);
  Region.storeNat64(myRegion, 16, position);
}

// Read metadata
func getMetadata() : {version : Nat64; count : Nat64; position : Nat64} {
  {
    version = Region.loadNat64(myRegion, 0);
    count = Region.loadNat64(myRegion, 8);
    position = Region.loadNat64(myRegion, 16);
  }
}
```

### Transaction log pattern

A transaction log pattern enables efficient appends while maintaining a structured, reliable state. This approach ensures that new log entries are appended sequentially, preventing data corruption and supporting an event-driven architecture where changes can be tracked over time.

```motoko no-repl
// Add an entry to a log
func appendToLog(data : Blob) {
  let meta = getMetadata();
  let position = meta.position;
  let size = Nat64.fromNat(data.size());
  
  // Store size followed by data
  Region.storeNat64(myRegion, position, size);
  Region.storeBlob(myRegion, position + 8, data);
  
  // Update metadata
  updateMetadata(
    meta.version, 
    meta.count + 1, 
    position + 8 + size
  );
}
```

## `Regions` comprehensive example

This example illustrates the simultaneous use of stable variables and stable memory. It uses a single stable variable, `state`, to keep track of the two regions and their size in bytes, but stores the contents of the log directly in stable memory.

```motoko no-repl
import Nat64 "mo:base/Nat64";
import Region "mo:base/Region";

persistent actor StableLog {

  // Index of saved log entry.
  public type Index = Nat64;

  // Internal representation uses two regions, working together.
  var state = { // implicitly `stable`
    bytes = Region.new();
    var bytes_count : Nat64 = 0;
    elems = Region.new ();
    var elems_count : Nat64 = 0;
  };

  // Grow a region to hold a certain number of total bytes.
  func regionEnsureSizeBytes(r : Region, new_byte_count : Nat64) {
    let pages = Region.size(r);
    if (new_byte_count > pages << 16) {
      let new_pages = ((new_byte_count + ((1 << 16) - 1)) / (1 << 16)) - pages;
      assert Region.grow(r, new_pages) == pages
    }
  };

  // Element = Position and size of a saved a Blob.
  type Elem = {
    pos : Nat64;
    size : Nat64;
  };

  transient let elem_size = 16 : Nat64; /* two Nat64s, for pos and size. */

  // Count of elements (Blobs) that have been logged.
  public func size() : async Nat64 {
      state.elems_count
  };

  // Constant-time random access to previously-logged Blob.
  public func get(index : Index) : async Blob {
    assert index < state.elems_count;
    let pos = Region.loadNat64(state.elems, index * elem_size);
    let size = Region.loadNat64(state.elems, index * elem_size + 8);
    let elem = { pos ; size };
    Region.loadBlob(state.bytes, elem.pos, Nat64.toNat(elem.size))
  };

  // Add Blob to the log, and return the index of it.
  public func add(blob : Blob) : async Index {
    let elem_i = state.elems_count;
    state.elems_count += 1;

    let elem_pos = state.bytes_count;
    state.bytes_count += Nat64.fromNat(blob.size());

    regionEnsureSizeBytes(state.bytes, state.bytes_count);
    Region.storeBlob(state.bytes, elem_pos, blob);

    regionEnsureSizeBytes(state.elems, state.elems_count * elem_size);
    Region.storeNat64(state.elems, elem_i * elem_size + 0, elem_pos);
    Region.storeNat64(state.elems, elem_i * elem_size + 8, Nat64.fromNat(blob.size()));
    elem_i
  }
};
```

## Performance considerations

Efficient use of stable memory requires optimizing read and write operations to reduce overhead. Batching multiple small writes into fewer, larger operations improves performance by minimizing the number of memory transactions. Large data structures should be aligned to page boundaries whenever possible, as crossing page boundaries can lead to additional processing overhead. Frequently accessed data should be cached in native memory to avoid repeated stable memory reads, which are slower than standard heap operations. Since stable memory is persistent, temporary or short-lived data should be stored in native memory instead, reducing unnecessary stable memory usage.

### Memory usage estimation

Estimating the amount of memory needed requires calculating the expected storage requirements based on entry size and quantity. The total memory requirement is determined by multiplying the average entry size by the number of expected entries, then adding an overhead buffer for metadata and alignment, typically between 10â€“20%. The resulting size is then divided by 65_536 bytes (the size of a page) to determine the number of pages required.

For example, if each entry is 200 bytes and the application expects to store 1_000 entries, the total raw memory usage is:

$$
1000 \times 200 = 200,000 \text{ bytes}
$$

Adding a 20% overhead increases this to:

$$
200,000 \times 1.2 = 240,000 \text{ bytes}
$$

To determine the number of stable memory pages needed, divide by the page size (65_536 bytes):

$$
\frac{240,000}{65,536} \approx 3.66
$$

Since stable memory allocations must be whole pages, this rounds up to 4 pages.

## Troubleshooting

Stable memory management can introduce issues such as out-of-bounds access, growth failures, and data corruption.

One common error is `accessing memory beyond allocated limits`, leading to out-of-bounds access. This occurs when attempting to read or write data beyond the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region)â€™s current size. To prevent this, always ensure the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) has been expanded sufficiently before performing operations.

A [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base/Region) may also fail to grow when calling `Region.grow()`, returning `0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF` instead of the previous size. This typically indicates that the stable memory limit has been reached. Implementing fallback strategies or optimizing memory usage can help mitigate this issue.

Data corruption can occur when memory layouts are mismanaged, resulting in unintended overwrites. Proper bounds checking and structured memory layouts help prevent this problem, ensuring that stored data remains intact.

### Debugging

Tracking memory usage is essential for preventing overflow and inefficiencies. Keeping counters for allocated vs. used memory helps detect excessive usage before it leads to failures. Assertions can be placed in key areas of the code to verify that offset calculations remain within valid bounds.

To ensure data integrity, checksums can be implemented to detect corruption, allowing verification of whether stored data has been altered unexpectedly. Additionally, placing known markers at structure boundaries helps identify memory misalignment and debugging inconsistencies.
