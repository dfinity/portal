# Custom Domains

By default all canisters on the Internet Computer are accessible through `ic0.app`
and their canister ID. In addition to that default domain, one can also host a
canister under a custom domain. This guide explains how to do that.

There are, essentially, two approaches to host a canister under a custom domain.

1. Register the domain with the boundary nodes;
1. Hosting the domain on your own infrastructure.

For both approaches, you need to acquire a domain through your favorite registrar.

The two approaches differ in the ease of use and the configurability. When registering
the domain with the boundary nodes, you simply has to configure the DNS records of
the custom domain and the boundary nodes take care of obtaining a certificate,
renewing the certificate before its expiration, SEO and serving the service worker.
When hosting the domain on your own infrastructure, you need to obtain and renew
the certificates, and to provide your own infrastructure that serves the service worker.
However, you are also more flexible in how you configure your domain (e.g., you
can serve a custom service worker).

## Custom Domains on the Boundary Nodes

In the following, we first list all the steps necessary to register your
custom domain with the boundary nodes. Then, we illustrate these instructions on
a concrete example. Finally, we explain how one can update and remove a registration.

### First Registration

1. Configure the DNS record of your domain, which we denote with `CUSTOM_DOMAIN`.
    * Add a `CNAME` entry for your domain pointing to `ic0.app` such that all the traffic destined to your domain is redirected to the boundary nodes;
    * Add a `TXT` entry containing the canister ID to the `_canister-id`-subdomain of your domain (e.g., `_canister-id.CUSTOM_DOMAIN`);
    * Add a `CNAME` entry for the `_acme-challenge`-subdomain (e.g., `_acme-challenge.CUSTOM_DOMAIN`) pointing to `_acme-challenge.CUSTOM_DOMAIN.icp2.io` in order for the boundary nodes to acquire the certificate.
1. Create a file named `ic-domains` in your canister under `.well-known` containing the custom domain.
    * By default, `dfx` excludes all files and directories, whose names starts with a `.`, from the asset canister. Hence, to include the `ic-domains`-file, you need to create an additional file, called `.ic-assets.json`.
    * Create a new file with the name `.ic-assets.json` inside a directory listed in `sources` in `dfx.json`..
    * Configure the `.well-known` directory to be included by writing the following configuration into the `.ic-assets.json`-file:
        ```
        [
            {
                "match": ".well-known",
                "ignore": false
            }
        ]
        ```
    * Deploy the updated canister.
1. Register the domain with the boundary nodes by issuing the following command and replacing `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` with your custom domain.
    ```sh
    curl -sLv -X POST \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        ic0.app/registrations \
        --data @- <<EOF
    {
        "name": "CUSTOM_DOMAIN"
    }
    EOF
    ```
    If the call was successful, you will get a request ID with which you can query the status of your registration request.
    In case the calls failed, you will get an error message explaining why.
1. Check the status of your registration request by issuing the following command and replacing `REQUEST_ID` with the ID you received in the previous step.
    ```sh
    curl -sLv -X GET \
        ic0.app/registrations/REQUEST_ID
    ```
    The status will be one of the following:
    * `pendingOrder`: The registration request has been submitted and is waiting to be picked up.
    * `pendingChallengeResponse`: The certificate has been ordered.
    * `pendingAcmeApproval`: The challenge has been completed.
    * `available`: The registration request has been successfully processed.
    * `failed`: The registration request failed.
1. Once your registration request becomes `available`, wait a few minutes for the certificate to become available on all boundary nodes. After that, you should be able to access your canister using the custom domain.

:::note
In many cases, it is not possible to set a `CNAME` record for the top of a domain, the Apex record. In this case, DNS providers support so-called `CNAME` flattening. To this end, these DNS providers offer flattened record types, such as `ANAME` or `ALIAS` records, which can be used instead of the `CNAME` to `ic0.app`.
:::

### Concrete Example

Imagine you wanted to register your domain `foo.bar.com` for your canister with the canister ID `hwvjt-wqaaa-aaaam-qadra-cai`.

1. DNS Configuration:
    | Record Type   | Host                        | Value                               |
    |---------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
    | `CNAME`       | foo.bar.com                 | ic0.app                             |
    | `TXT`         | _canister-id.foo.bar.com    | hwvjt-wqaaa-aaaam-qadra-cai         |
    | `CNAME`       | _acme-challenge.foo.bar.com | _acme-challenge.foo.bar.com.icp2.io |

    _Note:_ Some DNS providers do not require you to specify the main domain. For example, you would just have to specify `foo` for the first `CNAME` instead of `foo.bar.com`.
2. `.well-known/ic-domains`:
    * Create the `ic-domains` file with the following content in the `.well-known` directory:
        ```
        foo.bar.com
        ```
    * Create the `.ic-assets.json` file at the root of the canister source:
        ```
        [
            {
                "match": ".well-known",
                "ignore": false
            }
        ]
        ```
    * Deploy the updated canister.
3. Start the registration process:
    ```sh
    curl -sLv -X POST \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        ic0.app/registrations \
        --data @- <<EOF
    {
        "name": "foo.bar.com"
    }
    EOF
    ```

In the [following document](custom-domain/dns-setup.md), we provide detailed instructions to configure DNS
records on the example of two popular domain registrars.

### Updating a Custom Domain

In case you want to update the domain to point to a different canister, you first
need to update the DNS record of your domain and then notify a boundary node:

1. Update the `TXT` entry to contain the new canister ID for the `_canister-id`-subdomain of your domain (e.g., `_canister-id.CUSTOM_DOMAIN`).
1. Notify a boundary node of the change using a PUT request and the ID of your registration (`REQUEST_ID`).
    ```sh
    curl -sLv -X PUT \
        ic0.app/registrations/REQUEST_ID
    ```

:::note
In case you forgot the ID of your registration, you can just submit another registration
request for your domain and the boundary node will return the corresponding ID.
:::

### Removing a Custom Domain

In case you want to remove your domain, you just need to remove the DNS records
and notify a boundary node:

1. Remove the `TXT` entry containing the canister ID for `_canister-id`-subdomain (e.g., `_canister-id.CUSTOM_DOMAIN`) and the `CNAME` entry for the `_acme-challenge`-subdomain (e.g., `_acme-challenge.CUSTOM_DOMAIN`).
1. Notify a boundary node of the removal using a DELETE request.
    ```sh
    curl -sLv -X DELETE \
        ic0.app/registrations/REQUEST_ID
    ```

:::note
In case you forgot the ID of your registration, you can just submit another registration
request for your domain and the boundary node will return the corresponding ID.

## Custom Domains using your Own Infrastructure

1. Deploy your canister to the IC and note the canister id.
1. Clone the [official IC repo](https://github.com/dfinity/ic) and navigate to the [service worker folder](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/typescript/service-worker) located under `ic/typescript/service-worker`.
1. Map your domain to the canister ID by adding your domain-to-canister mapping to `hostnameCanisterIdMap` in the file [`service-worker/src/sw/domains/static.ts`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/typescript/service-worker/src/sw/domains/static.ts).
1. Build the service worker according to the instructions in `service-worker/README.md`. The output should be:
    - an `index.html`,
    - a minified `.js` file, and
    - a `.map` file.
1. Host the assets (`index.html`, `.js` and `.map` files) from a server or CDN and point your custom domain name at this server.
1. Test.

:::caution
For websites that use Internet Identity (II) to authenticate users: The principals provided by II depend on the domain from which the login request was started. So if you authenticate your users through the canister URL and want to switch over to a custom domain, users will not have the same principals anymore. You can prevent this by setting up [Alternative Origins](../../references/ii-spec.md#alternative-frontend-origins).
