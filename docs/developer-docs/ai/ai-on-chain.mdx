# Image classification sample

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Tutorial", "Rust" ]} />

## Overview

ICP's unique ability to run compute at scale allows AI and neural networks to run directly on-chain within a canister smart contract.

To showcase this capability, this demo example displays how an AI that identifies an image can be deployed as a smart contract with a frontend and backend, both running on-chain.

You can find the source code for this demo [on GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/image-classification).

## How this example works

In this example, the ICP smart contract accepts an image as input from the user and runs an image classification inference. The smart contract has two canisters:

- The frontend canister that contains HTML, JS, and CSS assets that are served in the web browser.

- The backend canister that embeds the [Tract ONNX inference engine](https://github.com/sonos/tract) with the [MobileNet v2-7 model](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/validated/vision/classification/mobilenet). This canister provides a `classify()` endpoint that the frontend canister calls.

## ICP features that make it possible

To make running AI in a canister possible, two key ICP features are utilized:

- WebAssembly virtual machine: Canister code is compiled into Wasm modules to be deployed on ICP. The WebAssembly virtual machine supports standards such as the WebAssembly System Interface, which can be supported through a community tool called [wasi2ic](https://github.com/wasm-forge/wasi2ic).

  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/docs/ai-wasm.png")}
    alt="AI Demo: Wasm"
    width="800"
  />
</div>

- Deterministic time slicing (DTS): DTS splits the execution of very large messages that require billions of Wasm instructions across multiple execution rounds.

    src={useBaseUrl("/img/docs/ai-dts.png")}
    alt="AI Demo: DTS"
    width="800"
  />
</div>

### Important notes

The ICP mainnet subnets and `dfx` running a replica version older than `463296` may fail with an `instruction-limit-exceeded` error.

Currently, Wasm execution is not optimized for this workload. A single call executes about 24B instructions (~10s).

## Deploying the demo

### Prerequisites

- [x] Download and install the Rust programming language and Cargo as described in the [Rust installation instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) for your operating system.

- [x] Download and install the IC SDK package as described in the [installing the IC SDK](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install/) page.

- [x] Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- [x] Install [`wasi-skd-21.0`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/tag/wasi-sdk-21).

- [x] Export `CC_wasm32_wasi` in your shell such that it points to WASI clang and sysroot: `export CC_wasm32_wasi="/path/to/wasi-sdk-21.0/bin/clang --sysroot=/path/to/wasi-sdk-21.0/share/wasi-sysroot"`

- [x] Install [`wasi2ic`](https://github.com/wasm-forge/wasi2ic) and make sure that `wasi2ic` binary is in your `$PATH`.

### Downloading the example

You can clone the GitHub repo for this example with the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/examples.git
```

Then navigate into the directory for the AI demo:

```
cd examples/rust/image-classification
```

Download MobileNet v2-7 to `src/backend/assets/mobilenetv2-7.onnx` by running the script:

```
./download_model.sh
```

Install NodeJS dependencies for the frontend:

```
npm install
```

Add the following Rust target:

```
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

### Deploying the code

To deploy the example, first start `dfx`:

```
dfx start --clean --background
```

Then to deploy the canisters, run the command:

```
dfx deploy // Deploy locally
dfx deploy --network ic // Deploy to the mainnet
```

## Using the demo

Once deployed, open the frontend canister's URL in your browser. You'll see the demo's user interface:

<div class="text-center">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/docs/ai-demo-1.png")}
    alt="Using the AI demo"
    width="800"
  />
</div>

Click on the Internet Computer logo. You'll be prompted to select an image file from your local files. In this example, we'll use an astronaut image. Then, select 'Go':

<div class="text-center">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/docs/ai-demo-2.png")}
    alt="Using the AI demo"
    width="800"
  />
</div>

The smart contract will do some computation to infer what the image is. This process may take about 10 seconds.

<div class="text-center">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/docs/ai-demo-3.png")}
    alt="Using the AI demo"
    width="800"
  />
</div>

The image inference results will be returned:

<div class="text-center">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/docs/ai-demo-4.png")}
    alt="Using the AI demo"
    width="800"
  />
</div>
