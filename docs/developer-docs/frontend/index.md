# Building a web frontend

## Overview

The Internet Computer allows you to host frontends built with standard web technologies for your dapps, using
our [JavaScript agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/agent) as a communication layer. By using
the [asset canister](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/tree/master/src/canisters/frontend/ic-frontend-canister) provided by `dfx` to upload static files to the IC,
you will be able to run your entire application on decentralized technology. This section takes a closer look at the
default frontend template that is generated by running the `dfx new` command, configuring the frontend canister, and using other frameworks to
build the user interface for your projects.

Here are some quick links to tutorials with example code for various stages of developing your frontend dapp:

- [Customize the frontend](./custom-frontend.md): a tutorial on building a React dapp.

- Using [Candid](../backend/motoko/hello-location.md#candid-ui) as a bare-bones interface to expose and test the functions in a canister.

- Using [raw HTML and JavaScript](../backend/motoko/explore-templates.md#default-frontend) to display a simple HTML entry page.

- Using [React and compiled JavaScript](./custom-frontend.md) to embed HTML attributes and elements directly in a page.

- Using [React and TypeScript](./add-stylesheet.md) to import CSS properties from an external file.

## How the default templates are used

As you might have noticed in the tutorials, guides, or sample code projects, by default each project created with `dfx` includes a template `index.js` and `webpack.config.js` file.

By default, the `index.js` file imports an agent that is located in `src/declarations/project_frontend/` folder, where 'project' is your project's name (for this guide, the project's name is 'hello'). This directory will be generated by `dfx` when you run `dfx deploy`, either locally or when deploying to the IC.

The generated code for the agent will look like this:

`src/declarations/hello_frontend/index.js`:

```

import { Actor, HttpAgent } from "@dfinity/agent";

// Imports and re-exports candid interface
import { idlFactory } from "./hello_frontend.did.js";
export { idlFactory } from "./hello_frontend.did.js";

/* CANISTER_ID is replaced by webpack based on node environment
 * Note: canister environment variable will be standardized as
 * process.env.CANISTER_ID_<CANISTER_NAME_UPPERCASE>
 * beginning in dfx 0.15.0
 */
export const canisterId =
  process.env.CANISTER_ID_HELLO_FRONTEND ||
  process.env.HELLO_FRONTEND_CANISTER_ID;

export const createActor = (canisterId, options = {}) => {
  const agent = options.agent || new HttpAgent({ ...options.agentOptions });

  if (options.agent && options.agentOptions) {
    console.warn(
      "Detected both agent and agentOptions passed to createActor. Ignoring agentOptions and proceeding with the provided agent."
    );
  }

  // Fetch root key for certificate validation during development
  if (process.env.DFX_NETWORK !== "ic") {
    agent.fetchRootKey().catch((err) => {
      console.warn(
        "Unable to fetch root key. Check to ensure that your local replica is running"
      );
      console.error(err);
    });
  }

  // Creates an actor with using the candid interface and the HttpAgent
  return Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
    agent,
    canisterId,
    ...options.actorOptions,
  });
};

export const hello_frontend = createActor(canisterId);
```

Then, if you look at the `src/hello_frontend/src/index.js` file, you can see that it takes the generated actor, and uses it to make a call to the hello canister’s greet method:

```
import { hello_backend } from "../../declarations/hello_backend";

document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit", async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const button = e.target.querySelector("button");

  const name = document.getElementById("name").value.toString();

  button.setAttribute("disabled", true);

  // Interact with foo actor, calling the greet method
  const greeting = await hello_backend.greet(name);

  button.removeAttribute("disabled");

  document.getElementById("greeting").innerText = greeting;

  return false;
});
```

In many projects, you will be able to use the code under `declarations` without any changes, then customize your dapp's frontend by making changes
in `src/hello_frontend/assets` and `src/hello_frontend/src`. However, if your project has additional requirements, continue reading below.

## Modifying the webpack configuration

Because webpack is a popular and highly-configurable module bundler for JavaScript-based applications, new projects
create a default `webpack.config.js` file that makes it easy to add the specific modules, such as `react` and `markdown`, that you want to use.

### Entry and output configuration

In many cases, you can use the default `webpack.config.js` file as-is, without any modification, or you can add
plug-ins, modules, and other custom configuration to suit your needs. The specific changes you make to
the `webpack.config.js` configuration largely depend on the other tools and frameworks you want to use.

For example, if you have experimented with the [customizing the frontend](custom-frontend)
or [adding a stylesheet](add-stylesheet) frontend tutorials, you might have modified the following section to work with React
JavaScript:

```
        module: {
          rules: [
            { test: /\.(ts|tsx|jsx)$/, loader: "ts-loader" },
            { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader','css-loader'] }
          ]
        }
      };
    }
```

If your application does not use `dfx` to run your build script, you can provide the variables yourself. For example:

    DFX_NETWORK=ic NODE_ENV=production HELLO_CANISTER_ID=rrkah... npm run build

### Ensuring node.js is available in a project

Because projects rely on webpack to provide the framework for the default frontend, you must have `node.js` installed in
your development environment and accessible in the project directory.

- If you want to develop your project without using the default webpack configuration and canister aliases, you can
  remove the `frontend` canister from the `dfx.json` file or build your project using a specific canister name. For
  example, you can choose to build only the hello program without frontend assets by running the following command:

      dfx build hello_backend

- If you are using the default webpack configuration and running `dfx build` fails, you should try running `npm install`
  in the project directory then re-running `dfx build`.

- If running `npm install` in the project directory doesn’t fix the issue, you should check the configuration of
  the `webpack.config.js` file for syntax errors.

## Using other modules with the React framework

Several tutorials and sample projects in the [examples](https://github.com/dfinity/examples) repository illustrate how
to add React modules using the `npm install` command. You can use these modules to construct the user interface
components you want to use in your project. For example, you might run the following command to install
the `react-router` module:

    npm install --save react react-router-dom

You could then use the module to construct a navigation component similar to the following:

    import React from 'react';
    import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

    const Navigation = () => {
      return (
        <nav className="main-nav">
          <ul>
            <li><NavLink to="/myphotos">Remember</NavLink></li>
            <li><NavLink to="/myvids">Watch</NavLink></li>
            <li><NavLink to="/audio">Listen</NavLink></li>
            <li><NavLink to="/articles">Read</NavLink></li>
            <li><NavLink to="/contribute">Write</NavLink></li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
      );
    }

    export default Navigation;

## Iterate faster using webpack-dev-server

Starting with `dfx 0.7.7`, we now provide you with webpack-dev-server in our `dfx new` starter.

The webpack development server, `webpack-dev-server`, provides in-memory access to the webpack assets, enabling you to
make changes and see them reflected in the browser right away using live reloading.

To take advantage of the `webpack-dev-server`:

- #### Step 1: Create a new project and change to your project directory.

- #### Step 2: Start the IC locally, if necessary, with the `dfx start` command.
Then, deploy your dapp as you normally would, for example, by running the `dfx deploy` command.

- #### Step 3: Start the webpack development server by running the following command:

       npm start

- #### Step 4: Open a web browser and navigate to the asset canister for your application using port 8080.

   For example:

       http://localhost:8080

- #### Step 5: Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to your project directory.

- #### Step 6: Open the `src/hello_frontend/src/index.js` file for your project in a text editor and make changes to the content.

   For example, you might add an element to the page using JavaScript:

   document.body.onload = addElement;

       document.body.onload = addElement;

       function addElement () {
         // create a new div element
         const newDiv = document.createElement("div");

         // and give it some content
         const newContent = document.createTextNode("Test live page reloading!");

         // add the text node to the newly created div
         newDiv.appendChild(newContent);

         // add the newly created element and its content into the DOM
         const currentDiv = document.getElementById("div1");
         document.body.insertBefore(newDiv, currentDiv);
       }

- #### Step 7: Save your changes to the `index.js` file but leave the editor open to continue making changes.

- #### Step 8: Refresh the browser or wait for it to refresh on its own to see your change.

   When you are done working on the frontend for your project, you can stop the webpack development server by pressing
   Control-C.

## Using other frameworks

You may want to use a bundler other than webpack. Per-bundler instructions are not ready yet, but if you are familiar
with your bundler, the following steps should get you going:

- #### Step 1: Remove the `copy:types`, `prestart`, and `prebuild` scripts from `package.json`.

- #### Step 2: Run `dfx deploy` to generate the local bindings for your canisters.

- #### Step 3: Copy the generated bindings to a directory where you would like to keep them.

- #### Step 4: Modify `declarations/<canister_name>/index.js` and replace `process.env.<CANISTER_NAME>_CANISTER_ID` with the equivalent pattern for environment variables for your bundler.

    - Alternately hardcode the canister ID if that is your preferred workflow

- #### Step 5: Commit the declarations and import them in your codebase.
