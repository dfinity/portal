# Rust Hello, world!

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Rust", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

In this guide, you'll learn the steps required to write, compile, deploy, and interact with a Rust backend canister.

This guide will showcase a simple 'Hello, world!' example.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, assure you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in the [developer environment guide](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/dev-env) and have created a [Rust project](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/quickstart).

For more information on project structure and code organization, review the [project organization guide](./project-organization.mdx).

## Writing the `lib.rs` file

Open the `src/hello_world_backend/src/lib.rs` file in a text editor. Replace the existing content with the following:

```rust title="src/hello_world_backend/src/lib.rs"
#[ic_cdk::query]
fn greet(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello there, {}! This is an example greeting returned from a Rust backend canister!", name)
}
```

Save the file.

## Writing the `Cargo.toml` file

Open the `src/hello_world_backend/Cargo.toml` file in a text editor. Replace the existing content with the following:

``` toml title="src/hello_world_backend/Cargo.tom"
[package]
name = "hello_world_backend"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
candid = "0.8.2"
ic-cdk = "0.7.0"
```

Save the file.

## Deploying the canister locally

### Create

First, create an empty canister for the canister code to be installed into. To create the canister, run the command:

```bash
dfx start --clean --background
dfx canister create hello_world_backend
```

The output will resemble the following:

```bash
Creating canister hello_world_backend...
hello_world_backend canister created with canister id: br5f7-7uaaa-aaaaa-qaaca-cai
```

### Build

Next, you need to compile your program into a WebAssembly module that can be deployed on ICP by building the canister. To build the canister, run the command:

```bash
dfx build hello_world_backend
```

### Install

Then, install the compiled code into your canister with the command:

```bash
dfx canister install hello_world_backend
```

### Deploy

To deploy the canister, use the command:

```bash
dfx deploy hello_world_backend
```

This command deploys just the `hello_world_backend` canister. To deploy all canisters in the `dfx.json` file, use the command:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

## Deploying the canister to the mainnet

To deploy to the mainnet, you will need a balance of cycles.

[Learn more about how to get cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy-and-manage).

Once you have gotten cycles, check the status of the mainnet to confirm that your local environment can connect to it. You can ping the mainnet with the command:

```bash
dfx ping ic
```

The output should resemble the following:

```bash
{
  "ic_api_version": "0.18.0"  "impl_hash": "d639545e0f38e075ad240fd4ec45d4eeeb11e1f67a52cdd449cd664d825e7fec"  "impl_version": "8dc1a28b4fb9605558c03121811c9af9701a6142"  "replica_health_status": "healthy"  "root_key": [48, 129, 130, 48, 29, 6, 13, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 97, 0, 129, 76, 14, 110, 199, 31, 171, 88, 59, 8, 189, 129, 55, 60, 37, 92, 60, 55, 27, 46, 132, 134, 60, 152, 164, 241, 224, 139, 116, 35, 93, 20, 251, 93, 156, 12, 213, 70, 217, 104, 95, 145, 58, 12, 11, 44, 197, 52, 21, 131, 191, 75, 67, 146, 228, 103, 219, 150, 214, 91, 155, 180, 203, 113, 113, 18, 248, 71, 46, 13, 90, 77, 20, 80, 95, 253, 116, 132, 176, 18, 145, 9, 28, 95, 135, 185, 136, 131, 70, 63, 152, 9, 26, 11, 170, 174]
}
```

Then, to deploy the canister to the mainnet, use the command:

```bash
dfx deploy hello_world_backend --network ic
```

:::info
For all commands that are intended to interact with the mainnet, the `--network ic` flag needs to be used.
:::

## Interacting with the canister

To test the canister's functionality, call one of the canister's methods directly from the command line. In this example, this canister only has one method, `greet`, so that will be the one tested.

To test this method, make a call to the `greet` method with the command:

```bash
dfx canister call hello_world_backend greet everyone
```

The output will resemble:

```bash
("Hello there, everyone! This is an example greeting returned from a Rust backend canister!")
```

You can replace the last input string with any name you'd like, such as:

```bash
dfx canister call hello_world_backend greet Bob
```

This will return the output:

```bash
("Hello there, Bob! This is an example greeting returned from a Rust backend canister!")
```

In addition to testing the canister's functionality, the canister can be interacted with using other `dfx` commands. For example:

To deposit cycles from the wallet into the canister, use the command:

```
dfx canister deposit-cycles [cycles amount] [canister-name]
```

To get the identifier of a canister, use the command:

```
dfx canister id [canister-name]
```

To get a canister's Wasm module hash and its current controllers, use the command:

```
dfx canister info [canister-name]
```

## Testing the canister with PocketIC

[PocketIC](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/test/pocket-ic) is a lightweight, deterministic testing solution for programmatic testing of canisters that seamlessly integrates with existing testing infrastructure, such as `cargo test`.

You can learn more about PocketIC and how to install it [here](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/test/pocket-ic).

For Rust canisters, PocketIC can be imported into your project with the code:

```rust
use pocket_ic::PocketIc;
```

Then, in your code, you can create a new PocketIC instance with the code:

```rust
let pic = PocketIc::new();
```

The following is a complete example for testing a counter canister:

```rust
use candid::encode_one;
use pocket_ic::PocketIc;

 #[test]
 fn test_counter_canister() {
    let pic = PocketIc::new();
    // Create an empty canister as the anonymous principal and add cycles.
    let canister_id = pic.create_canister();
    pic.add_cycles(canister_id, 2_000_000_000_000);

    let wasm_bytes = load_counter_wasm(...);
    pic.install_canister(canister_id, wasm_bytes, vec![], None);
    // 'inc' is a counter canister method.
    call_counter_canister(&pic, canister_id, "inc");
    // Check if it had the desired effect.
    let reply = call_counter_canister(&pic, canister_id, "read");
    assert_eq!(reply, WasmResult::Reply(vec![0, 0, 0, 1]));
 }

fn call_counter_canister(pic: &PocketIc, canister_id: CanisterId, method: &str) -> WasmResult {
    pic.update_call(canister_id, Principal::anonymous(), method, encode_one(()).unwrap())
        .expect("Failed to call counter canister")
}
```
