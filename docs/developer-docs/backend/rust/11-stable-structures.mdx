# 11: Stable structures

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Rust", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

Stable structures are designed to use stable memory as the backing store, allowing them to grow to gigabytes in size without the need for `pre_upgrade`/`post_upgrade` hooks.

A [stable structure library](https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures#readme) exists which aims to simplify managing data structures directly in stable memory and provides example code templates.

For more information about stable structures, please see the [stable structures library](https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures) and [Roman's tutorial on stable structures](https://mmapped.blog/posts/14-stable-structures.html).
