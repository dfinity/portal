Applications for ICP start as **projects**. You can create new projects for ICP using the IC SDK. This guide focuses on how to create, build, and deploy a Rust program by using the `dfx` parent command and its subcommands.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, assure you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in the [developer environment guide](./dev-env.mdx).

## Creating a new Rust project

To create a new Rust project using the IC SDK, open a terminal window and run the following command:

Use `dfx new <project_name>` to create a new project:

```bash
dfx start --clean --background
dfx new rust_hello --type=rust
```

Next, navigate into your project directory by running the following command:

```bash
cd rust_hello
```

## Register, build, and deploy your project

After you connect to the local replica running in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your project locally.

Register, build, and deploy the canisters specified in the `dfx.json` file by running the following command:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

The `dfx deploy` command output displays information about each of the operations it performs, similar to the following excerpt:

```
Creating a wallet canister on the local network.
The wallet canister on the "local" network for user "default" is "rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai"
Deploying all canisters.

URLs:
Frontend canister via browser
    rust_hello_frontend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
Backend canister via Candid interface:
    rust_hello_backend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai&id=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
```

## Testing the dapp

There are several ways to interact with your canisters. Let's talk about access from the browser first.

To access the frontend canister (`rust_hello_frontend`) you can simply follow the link that was printed in the terminal in the previous step.


```
    Frontend canister via browser
        rust_hello_frontend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
```

Frontend canisters, also called **asset canisters**, allow access to web content directly from a smart contract. This enables you to deploy your entire dapp, not just the backend, on ICP.

To access the backend canister (`rust_hello_backend`) you can again open the URL printed to your terminal in the previous step.
```
Backend canister via Candid interface:
        rust_hello_backend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai&id=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
```
Using this method, open the [`Candid UI` URL](https://github.com/dfinity/candid/tree/master/tools/ui) that is automatically deployed to your local replica when you first ran `dfx deploy`. The `Candid UI` canister fetches the interface from your backend canister and allows you to test and browse your canister's API with a visual web interface.

To test the deployed `rust_hello_backend` locally from your command line using dfx, you can run the `greet` function by running the following command:

```bash
dfx canister call rust_hello_backend greet world
```

Then, verify that the call to the `rust_hello_backend` canister `greet` function returns a text message `("Hello, world!")`.

## Stopping the local canister execution environment

After testing the application, you can stop the local replica so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local replica running on your computer, run the following command:

```bash
dfx stop
```

When dfx is started again in the future, it should be started with the `dfx start --clean` command to wipe the previous state.
