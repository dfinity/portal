# 2: Project organization

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Motoko" ]} />


## Overview

As a preview, the following diagram illustrates the development work flow when running the Internet Computer locally on you computer.

![Development work flow](_attachments/dev-workflow-explore.svg)

To explore the code organization of a Motoko project, start by creating a new project by running the following command:


<Tabs groupId="version">
<TabItem value="0-17-0" label="dfx v0.17.0 or newer" default>

Use `dfx new <project_name>` to create a new project:

```
dfx new explore_hello
```

You will be prompted to select a language that your backend canister will use:

```
? Select a backend language: ›
❯ Motoko
  Rust
  TypeScript (Azle)
  Python (Kybra)
```

Then, select a frontend framework for your frontend canister, or select 'No frontend canister':

```
  ? Select a frontend framework: ›
❯ SvelteKit
  React
  Vue
  Vanilla JS
  No JS template
  No frontend canister
```

Lastly, you can include extra features to be added to your project:

```
  ? Add extra features (space to select, enter to confirm) ›
⬚ Internet Identity
⬚ Bitcoin (Regtest)
⬚ Frontend tests
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="0-16-1" label="dfx v0.16.1 or older" default>

```bash
dfx new explore_hello
```

For projects created with `dfx new` (Motoko and Rust) the command automatically generates the project's default configuration and two default smart contracts.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `dfx new explore_hello` command creates a new `explore_hello` project, including a default project directory structure under the new project name and a new Git repository for your project. If you have `node.js` installed locally, creating a new project also adds some template frontend code and dependencies.

To ensure that project names are valid when used in JavaScript, Motoko, and other contexts, you should only use alphanumeric characters and underscores. You cannot include dashes or any special characters.

View the default directory structure by running the following command:

```
ls -l explore_hello
```

By default, the project directory structure includes at least one source subdirectory, a template `README.md` file, and a default `dfx.json` configuration file.

Depending on whether you have `node.js` installed, your project directory might include some or all of the following files:

```
explore_hello/
├── README.md      # default project documentation
├── dfx.json       # project configuration file
├── node_modules   # libraries for frontend development
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src            # source files directory
│   ├── explore_hello_backend
│   │   └── main.mo
│   ├── explore_hello_frontend
│       ├── assets
│       │   ├── logo.png
│       │   ├── main.css
│       │   └── sample-asset.txt
│       └── src
│           ├── index.html
│           └── index.js
└── webpack.config.js
```

At a minimum, the default project directory includes the following folders and files:

-   A default `README` file for documenting your project in the repository.

-   A default `dfx.json` configuration file to set configurable options for your project.

-   A default `src` directory for all of the source files required by your dapp.

The default `src/explore_hello_backend/` directory includes a template `main.mo` file that you can modify or replace to include your core programming logic.

Because this guide focuses on the basics of getting started, you are only going to use the `main.mo` file. If you have `node.js` installed, your project directory includes additional files and directories that you can use to define the frontend interface for your dapp. Frontend development and the template files in the `assets` folder are discussed a little later.

## Review the default configuration

By default, creating a new project adds some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize the configuration settings for your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To review the default configuration file for your project, open the `dfx.json` configuration file in a text editor to review the default settings.

The contents of the file should resemble the following:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "explore_hello_backend": {
      "main": "src/explore_hello_backend/main.mo",
      "type": "motoko"
    },
    "explore_hello_frontend": {
      "dependencies": [
        "dexplore_hello_backend"
      ],
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/explore_hello_frontend/src/index.html"
      },
      "source": [
        "src/explore_hello_frontend/assets",
        "dist/explore_hello_frontend/"
      ],
      "type": "assets"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "args": "",
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env",
  "version": 1
}%
```


Let’s take a look at a few of the default settings.

- There are two canisters defined in this file; `explore_hello_frontend` and `explore_hello_backend`.
- The `explore_hello_backend` canister has a `main` attribute which specifics the file path of the program's core file, `main.mo`.
- The `explore_hello_backend` canister has a `type` of 'motoko`, which specifies the programming language. If the canister was written in Rust, this value would read 'rust'.
- The `explore_hello_frontend` canister has a dependency of the `explore_hello_backend` canister, meaning it relies on the backend canister to be deployed and running for it to be deployed and ran.
- The `explore_hello_frontend` canister has a frontend endpoint of `src/explore_hello_frontend/src/index.html`, which specifies the primary frontend asset.
- Additional assets for the `explore_hello_frontend` canister are specified in the `source` configuration.
- Lastly, the `explore_hello_frontend` canister has a `type` of 'assets', configuring it as a frontend asset canister.

## Review the default program code

New projects always include a template `main.mo` source code file. You can edit this file to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

Let’s take a look at the sample program in the default `main.mo` template file as a starting point for creating simple dapp using the Motoko programming language.

To review the default sample program for your project, open the `src/explore_hello_backend/main.mo` file in a text editor and review the code in the template:

```motoko
actor {
  public query func greet(name : Text) : async Text {
    return "Hello, " # name # "!";
  };
};
```

Let’s take a look at a few key elements of this program:

-   You might notice that this sample code defines an `actor` instead of a `main` function, which some programming languages require. For Motoko, the `main` function is implicit in the file itself.

-   Although the traditional "Hello, World!" program illustrates how you can print a string using a `print` or `println` function, that traditional program would not represent a typical use case for Motoko dapps that run on the Internet Computer.

-   Instead of a print function, this sample program defines an `actor` with a public `greet` function that takes a `name` argument with a type of `Text`.

-   The program then uses the `async` keyword to indicate that the program returns an asynchronous message consisting of a concatenated text string constructed using `"Hello, "`, the `#` operator, the `name` argument, and `"!"`.

You’ll explore code that uses `actor` objects and asynchronous message handling more a little later. For now, you can continue to the next section.

## Next steps

Next, let's set up our [developer environment](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/motoko/dev-env) before deploying the dapp.
