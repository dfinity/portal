## Setting up your environment 

Before you start your project, verify the following:

- [x] You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.

- [x] You have a command line interface (CLI) window open. This window is also referred to as the 'terminal' window.

- [x] You have stopped any local execution environment processes running on your computer.

- [x] You have downloaded and installed the IC SDK package as described in the [installing the IC SDK](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install/) page.

- [x] You have a code editor installed. The [VSCode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is a popular choice.

- [x] You have downloaded and installed [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- [x] Assure that all packages and tools above are updated to the latest release versions.
