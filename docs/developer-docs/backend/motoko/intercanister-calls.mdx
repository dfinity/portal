# 7: Making inter-canister calls

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Motoko", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview
One of the most important features of the Internet Computer blockchain for developers is the ability to call functions in one canister from another canister. This capability to make calls between canisters, also sometimes referred to as **inter-canister calls**, enables you to reuse and share functionality in multiple dapps.

For example, you might want to create a dapp for professional networking, organizing community events, or hosting fundraising activities. Each of these dapps might have a social component that enables users to identify social relationships based on some criteria or shared interest, such as friends and family or current and former colleagues.

To address this social component, you might want to create a single canister for storing user relationships then write your professional networking, community organizing, or fundraising application to import and call functions that are defined in the canister for social connections. You could then build additional applications to use the social connections canister or extend the features provided by the social connections canister to make it useful to an even broader community of other developers.

This example will showcase a simple way to configure inter-canister calls that can be used as the foundation for more elaborate projects and use-cases such as those mentioned above. 

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, assure you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in the [developer environment guide](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/motoko/dev-env).

## Create a new dfx project 

Open a terminal window on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.

First, create a new dfx project with the command:

<Tabs groupId="version">
<TabItem value="0-17-0" label="dfx v0.17.0 or newer" default>

Use `dfx new <project_name>` to create a new project:

```
dfx new intercanister
```

You will be prompted to select a language that your backend canister will use:

```
? Select a backend language: ›  
❯ Motoko
  Rust
  TypeScript (Azle)
  Python (Kybra)
```

Then, select a frontend framework for your frontend canister, or select 'No frontend canister':

```
  ? Select a frontend framework: ›  
❯ SvelteKit
  React
  Vue
  Vanilla JS
  No JS template
  No frontend canister
```

Lastly, you can include extra features to be added to your project:

```
  ? Add extra features (space to select, enter to confirm) ›
⬚ Internet Identity
⬚ Bitcoin (Regtest)
⬚ Frontend tests
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="0-16-1" label="dfx v0.16.1 or older" default>

```bash
dfx new intercanister
```

For projects created with `dfx new` (Motoko and Rust) the command automatically generates the project's default configuration and two default smart contracts. 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, navigate into the project's directory:

```
cd intercanister
```

Create two new directories under the `src` directory for your new canisters:

```
mkdir src/canister1
mkdir src/canister2
```

Create a new file, `src/canister1/main.mo`.

In this file, insert the following code:

```motoko
import Canister2 "canister:canister2";

actor {
    public func main() : async Nat {
        return await Canister2.getValue();
    };
};
```

Then, create another new file, `src/canister2/main.mo`.

In this file, insert the following code:

```motoko
import Prim "mo:prim";

actor {
    public func getValue() : async Nat {
        Prim.debugPrint("Hello from canister 2!");
        return 10;
    };
};
```

Open the `dfx.json` file and delete the existing content. Then, insert the following code:

```json
{
 "canisters": {
  "canister1": {
    "main": "src/canister1/main.mo",
    "type": "motoko"
  },
  "canister2": {
    "main": "src/canister2/main.mo",
    "type": "motoko"
  }
},
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "args": "",
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env",
  "version": 1
}
```

## Starting the local canister execution environment 

To start the local execution environment on your local computer, run the following command:

```
dfx start --clean
```

:::info
This guide uses the `--clean` option to start the local canister execution environment in a clean state.

This option removes any orphan background processes or canister identifiers that might disrupt normal operations. For example, if you forgot to issue a `dfx stop` when moving between projects, you might have a process running in the background or in another terminal. The `--clean` option ensures that you can start the local canister execution environment and continue to the next step without manually finding and terminating any running processes.
:::

## Deploy your project 

Deploy your new canisters with the command in your project's directory:

```
dfx deploy
```

## Interacting with the canisters

Use the following command to make a call from `canister1` to `canister2`:

```
dfx canister call canister1 main 
```

The output should resemble the following:

```
2023-06-15 15:53:39.567801 UTC: [Canister ajuq4-ruaaa-aaaaa-qaaga-cai] Hello from canister 2!
(10 : nat)
```

Alternatively, you can also use a canister id to access a previously deployed canister by using the following piece of code in the `src/canister1/main.mo` file:

```motoko
actor {
    public func main(canisterId: Text) : async Nat {
        let canister2 = actor(canisterId): actor { getValue: () -> async Nat };
        return await canister2.getValue();
    };
};
```

Then, use the following call, replacing `canisterID` with the principal ID of a previously deployed canister:

```
dfx canister call canister1 main "canisterID"
```

For example, for a canister with the principal ID of `ajuq4-ruaaa-aaaaa-qaaga-cai`, which is the principal ID of `canister2` that was used earlier:

```
dfx canister call canister1 main "ajuq4-ruaaa-aaaaa-qaaga-cai"
```
