## Overview

This at-a-glance cheat sheet summarizes the steps to follow for quick reference.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, assure you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in the [developer environment guide](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/motoko/dev-env).

## Creating a new project

Open a terminal window on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.

Create a new project and change to the project directory.

## Editing the default files

Edit the `src/<project_name>_backend` files to define your service or application.

Edit the `src/<project_name>_frontend` files with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that provides the frontend for your service or application.

## Starting the deployment environment

Start the Internet Computer for local development or check your connection to the Internet Computer for network deployment:
- [Local deployment](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/local).
- [Mainnet deployment](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/mainnet).

## Register, build, and deploy locally or on the mainnet 

To deploy locally, use the command:

```
dfx deploy
```

For deploying to the mainnet, use: `--network ic`.

```
dfx deploy --network <network>
```

## View your service or application in a browser, using the URLS in the output of the `dfx deploy` command:

```
