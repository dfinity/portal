# vetKeys example

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Tutorial"]} />

This demo provides a canister (`src/system_api`) that demonstrates how the [proposed vetKD system API](https://github.com/dfinity/portal/pull/3763) can be used to provide caller-specific symmetric keys that can be used for AES encryption and decryption.


Live demo:  https://h62xu-2iaaa-aaaal-qshoq-cai.icp0.io/

## Create a file transfer

1. Get recipient's public key

Specify recipient's Ethereum address, then the `vetkd_public_key` method retrieves the recipient's public key using their Ethereum address to identify the IBE scheme that generates the public key.



```rust reference https://github.com/kristoferlund/send_file_to_eth_demo/blob/main/src/backend/src/vetkd/controller/vetkd_public_key.rs
```

:::info
This example uses a testing variation of the vetKeys feature. When the feature is available, this should be replaced with an actual vetKeys canister call.

2. Encrypt file in the frontend


3. Store encrypted file in the backend


## Receive and decrypt a file
