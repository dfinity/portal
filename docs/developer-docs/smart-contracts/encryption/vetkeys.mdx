# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

The vetKeys feature is in ongoing development on ICP. It stands for ‘Verifiable Encrypted Threshold Keys’ and enables a number of cryptographic functionalities on ICP. The primary motivation for vetKeys is to facilitate on-chain encryption, as such the primer is focused with that example in mind.

To dive into the technical overview, please refer to:

- [vetKeys technology overview](/docs/current/references/vetkeys-overview).
- [vetKeys primer](https://internetcomputer.org/blog/features/vetkey-primer).

## Using vetKeys

As this feature is still in development, a [brief demo for using the API exists](using-vetkeys.mdx).
