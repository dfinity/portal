## Overview

Canisters contain both code and state. Once you have written the code for a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>, the canister doesn't exist until it is registered with ICP, either locally, on the playground, or on the mainnet.

Canisters are created with [`dfx canister create`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-create). They are initially empty and do not contain program code. The code must be [compiled](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/compile) into Wasm and [installed](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/install) into the empty canister before it can be deployed.

Create your canisters from within the project's directory:

- `dfx canister create <canister_name>`: Create a canister locally. The local replica must be running to create a canister locally. Start it with `dfx start --background`.

- `dfx canister create <canister_name> --network=playground`: Create a canister on the playground. Creating a canister on the playground is free, but canisters are temporary and will be removed after 20 minutes.

- `dfx canister create <canister_name> --network=ic`: Create a canister on the mainnet. Creating a canister on the mainnet will cost [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/gas-cost).

- `dfx canister create --all --network=ic`: Create all canisters in the project's `dfx.json` file on the mainnet.

:::tip
Settings can be configured while creating a canister using optional flags. [View the full list of settings](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-create).
:::

When a canister is created, the following steps happen:

- A canister ID is registered with the local replica or the mainnet for each canister in the project's `dfx.json` file.

- The following canister components are created:
  - List of controllers.
  - Cycles balance.
  - Reserved cycles balance.
  - Canister status.
  - Resource reservations.

- Each canister ID is returned in the command line.
