# Topping up a canister

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

A <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> needs to have cycles deposited continuously into it to pay for the resources it uses. This process is known as 'topping up' the canister. Topping up canisters is routine maintenance.

## Basic rules

Anyone can top up any canister deployed to ICP; you do not need to be the owner or controller of the canister. All you need is the canister's principal.

There are a few different ways to top up canisters:

- Using [`dfx cycles top-up`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-cycles#dfx-cycles-top-up).

- Through the [NNS frontend dapp](https://nns.ic0.app).

- Through a [third-party service](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/topping-up/cycles_management_services) (e.g. https://cycleops.dev).

### Number of cycles

For ease of use, you can copy/paste the cycles amounts below:

| Cycles            | Number        |
| -----------       | -----------   |
| 1 million         | 1000000         |
| 10 million        | 10000000         |
| 100 million       | 100000000         |
| 1 billion         | 1000000000         |
| 10 billion        | 10000000000         |
| 100 billion       | 100000000000         |
| 1 trillion        | 1000000000000         |
| 10 trillion       | 10000000000000         |
| 100 trillion      | 100000000000000         |

## Canister top up workflows

The following examples will demonstrate how to interact with and top up a canister with the canister ID `jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai` with one trillion cycles (1000000000000) or one ICP's worth of cycles. These instructions will work for any canister ID or cycles/ICP amount.

### Checking the cycles balance of a canister

Canister cycles balances are available through the [`dfx canister status`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-status) command. They are not exposed publicly by default; you can only see them if you are the controller of a canister:

```bash
dfx canister status jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai --network=ic
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```bash
Canister status call result for jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai.

```

Canisters can check their balance programmatically.

Motoko canisters can use the [ExperimentalCycles library](/docs/current/motoko/main/base/ExperimentalCycles) to interact with cycles.

Rust canisters can use the function `canister_balance128()` from the [Rust IC CDK](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/fn.canister_balance128.html).

### Option 1: If you have ICP on your account

If you have ICP associated with your [developer identity](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/identities) you can use [`dfx ledger top-up`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-ledger) to convert some ICP into cycles, then top up a canister with those cycles:

### Option 2: If you have cycles

If you already have cycles, you can top up a canister with the command [`dfx cycles top-up`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-cycles#dfx-cycles-top-up):

```bash
dfx cycles top-up jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai 1T --network ic
```

### Special case: topping up a cycles wallet

:::danger
The cycles wallet will be removed from `dfx` in a future release.

It is recommended to use the cycles ledger instead.
:::

Cycles wallets are canisters like any other. If you have a cycles wallet you control via `dfx`, there is another option for sending cycles from your cycles wallet to a canister of your choice: [`dfx wallet send [OPTIONS] <DESTINATION> <AMOUNT>`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-wallet#dfx-wallet-send).


## Topping up a canister with the NNS frontend dapp

You can also top up any canister via the [NNS frontend dapp](https://nns.ic0.app):

- #### Step 1: Navigate to the **My Canisters** section of the dapp.
- #### Step 2: Click **Link Canister**.
- #### Step 3: Add a canister principal. The user doesn't need to control the canister.
- #### Step 4: Once the canister is added, click on that canister.
- #### Step 5: Click `Add cycles` to add cycles using the ICP in your NNS frontend dapp.

## Managing cycle depletion with freezing threshold

ICP features a mechanism to prevent canisters from running out of cycles. Canisters have a configurable `freezing_threshold`, dynamically evaluated in cycles.
