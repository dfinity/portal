# Topping up a canister

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

A <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> needs to have cycles deposited continuously into it to pay for the resources it uses. This process is known as 'topping up' the canister. Topping up canisters is routine maintenance.

## Basic rules

Anyone can top up any canister deployed to ICP; you do not need to be the owner or controller of the canister. All you need is the canister's principal.

There are a few different ways to top up canisters, such as:

- Using [`dfx`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/).

- Through the [NNS frontend dapp](https://nns.ic0.app).

- Through a [third-party service](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/topping-up/cycles_management_services) (e.g. https://cycleops.dev).

### Number of cycles

For ease of use, you can copy/paste the cycles amounts below:

| Cycles            | Number        |
| -----------       | -----------   |
| 1 million         | 1000000         |
| 10 million        | 10000000         |
| 100 million       | 100000000         |
| 1 billion         | 1000000000         |
| 10 billion        | 10000000000         |
| 100 billion       | 100000000000         |
| 1 trillion        | 1000000000000         |
| 10 trillion       | 10000000000000         |
| 100 trillion      | 100000000000000         |

## Canister top up workflows

The following examples will demonstrate how to interact with and top up a canister with the canister ID `jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai` with a million cycles (1000000). These instructions will work for any canister ID or cycles amount.

### Checking the cycles balance of a canister

Canister cycles balances are not exposed publicly by default; you can only see them if you are the controller of a canister. Using `jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai` as an example, you can query it by calling:

```bash
dfx canister status jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai --network ic
```

The output will look like this:

```bash
Canister status call result for jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai.
Status: Running
Controllers: mto6d-zfnut-rlsxr-ogdeg-apo53-evpob-ljgnp-ma2x3-6yf3b-t4rd5-qqe t5j57-vyaaa-aaaal-qatsq-cai
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(2471918)
Balance: 9_811_813_913_485 Cycles
Module hash: 0xe7866e1949e3688a78d8d29bd63e1c13cd6bfb8fbe29444fa606a20e0b1e33f0
```

Canisters can check their own balance programmatically. For example:

<AdornedTabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

Motoko canisters can use the [ExperimentalCycles library](/docs/current/motoko/main/base/ExperimentalCycles) to interact with cycles:

``` motoko no-repl
import Cycles "mo:base/ExperimentalCycles";
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";

actor {
  public func main() : async() {
    Debug.print("Main balance: " # debug_show(Cycles.balance()));
  };
}

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

Rust canisters can use the function `canister_balance128()` from the [Rust IC CDK](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/fn.canister_balance128.html):

```rust
let current_canister_balance = ic_cdk::api::canister_balance();
```

</TabItem>

### Option 1: If you have ICP on your account

If you have ICP on the account associated with a `dfx` identity, you can tell the ledger canister to take some of that ICP, convert it to cycles, and give it to a canister of your choice using the command `dfx ledger top-up --icp <AMOUNT> <DESTINATION> --network ic`:

```bash
dfx ledger account-id
dfx ledger balance --network ic
dfx ledger top-up --icp 1 jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai --network ic
```

-   The `dfx ledger account-id` returns the ledger account ID of the current `dfx` identity used.
-   The `dfx ledger --network ic balance` command checks the balance on the `account` associated with the current `dfx` identity used.
-   `top-up --icp 1 jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai` command converts 1 ICP into cycles and uses them to refill canister `jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai`.
-   `--network ic` tells `dfx` to use the mainnet as the network (rather than the local replica).

### Option 2: If you have cycles

If you have a cycles balance associated with your developer identity, you can top up a canister with the command `dfx cycles top-up <DESTINATION> <AMOUNT>`:

```bash
dfx cycles balance --network ic
dfx cycles top-up jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai 1 --network ic
```

:::warning
This workflow uses the cycles ledger, a feature that requires `dfx` version `0.19.0`. To enable this feature, you will need to set the following environmental variable:

```bash
DFX_CYCLES_LEDGER_SUPPORT_ENABLE=1
```
:::

-   The `cycles balance --network ic` command checks the cycles balance of your identity on the mainnet.
-   The `cycles top-up` command transfers cycles to the canister of your choice.

### Special case: topping up a cycles wallet

:::info
Please note that the cycles wallet will be removed from `dfx` in a future release.

It is recommended to use the cycles ledger instead.
:::

Cycles wallets are canisters like any other, so you can top them up as well. If you have a cycles wallet you control via dfx, there is another option as well for sending cycles from your cycles wallet to a canister of your choice: `dfx wallet send [OPTIONS] <DESTINATION> <AMOUNT>`.

In this example, it is assumed you are sending cycles to a cycles wallet with the principal ID `dfds-sddds-aaaal-qbsms-cai`.

```bash
dfx wallet balance --network ic
dfx wallet send 1000000 dfds-sddds-aaaal-qbsms-cai --network ic
```

-   The `wallet balance --network ic ` checks the cycles balance of your cycles wallet on the mainnet.
-   The `wallet send 1000000 dfds-sddds-aaaal-qbsms-cai --network ic` takes 1000000 cycles from your cycles wallet and sends them to cycles wallet `dfds-sddds-aaaal-qbsms-cai`.

## Topping up a canister with the NNS frontend dapp

You can also top up any canister via the [NNS frontend dapp](https://nns.ic0.app):

- #### Step 1: Navigate to the **My Canisters** section of the dapp.
- #### Step 2: Click **Link Canister**.
- #### Step 3: Add a canister principal. It is not necessary for the user to actually control said canister.
- #### Step 4: Once the canister is added, click on that canister.
- #### Step 5: Click `Add cycles` to add cycles using the ICP in your NNS frontend dapp.

## Managing cycle depletion with freezing threshold

ICP features a mechanism to prevent canisters from running out of cycles. Canisters have a configurable `freezing_threshold`, dynamically evaluated in cycles.

In the output of the `dfx canister status` command, you may have noticed the `freezing threshold` value. The freezing threshold is a value defined in seconds, which is used to calculate how many cycles a canister must retain in its cycles balance. This calculation is based off of the canister's memory consumption. The default freezing threshold value is `2_592_000s`, which corresponds to 30 days.

The freezing threshold is important because if a canister runs out of cycles, it will be uninstalled. The freezing threshold protects it from deletion, since if the cycles balance dips below the threshold, the canister will stop processing any new requests; however, it will continue to reply to existing requests.

For example, to set a freezing threshold for your `poll_backend` canister, use the command:

``````bash
dfx canister update-settings poll_backend --freezing-threshold 3472000
```

Then, you can confirm that this threshold has been set by running the `dfx canister status poll_backend --network ic ` command again:

```bash
Canister status call result for poll_backend.
