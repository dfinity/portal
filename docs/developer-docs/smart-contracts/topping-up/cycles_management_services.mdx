# Using a cycles management service

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

## Overview

Once a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> is deployed to the Internet Computer, the compute and storage it utilizes must be pre-payed. The process of burning ICP to obtain cycles and transferring them to a canister is referred to as "topping-up" a canister.

Cycles management services provide canister monitoring and automated cycles top-ups to ensure canisters applications remain up and running and do not run out of cycles.

Instead of manually topping up a canister via `dfx` or scripting a custom solution, cycles management services provide tested top-up automation and and canister metric insights.
