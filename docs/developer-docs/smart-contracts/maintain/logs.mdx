# Logging

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

The <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> logging feature is designed to provide developers with insight into their canister's behavior and assist with scenarios where their canister traps. This feature supports log messages for:

- Heartbeats.

- Timers.

- Pre/post upgrade and `canister_init`.

- Update calls.

- Queries, only if called in replicated mode.

A canister's controller is able to retrieve the canister's logs, even when executions trap, using `dfx canister logs`.

:::info
Non-replicated calls currently do not supported in regards to logging

## Using `dfx`

A canister's logs can be viewed using the [`dfx canister logs`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister/#dfx-canister-logs) command. As an example, consider a Rust canister with the following code:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

use candid::{Nat, Principal};
use ic_cdk::{
    export_candid, println,
};

thread_local! {
    // create a cell that holds a counter
    static COUNTER: std::cell::RefCell<u32> = RefCell::default();
}


#[ic_cdk::update]
fn produce_logs() {
    // print the counter value
    COUNTER.with_borrow_mut(|counter| {
        println!("counter: {}", *counter);
        *counter += 1;
    });
}

export_candid!();
```

This simple canister provides an incremental counter method that includes a print function that will return output to the command line and the canister's logs.

:::info
Note that this example uses update calls, as non-replicated query calls do not currently support logging.
:::

You can call the canister's method and view the associated logged output for each call. For example, if this canister is deployed as `logs_backend`, you can call the canister's `produce_logs` method a few times to increment the counter and get the following command line output:

```
dfx canister call logs_backend produce_logs
2024-06-04 21:14:25.882276 UTC: [Canister br5f7-7uaaa-aaaaa-qaaca-cai] counter: 0
()
dfx canister call logs_backend produce_logs
2024-06-04 21:18:18.094003 UTC: [Canister br5f7-7uaaa-aaaaa-qaaca-cai] counter: 1
()
dfx canister call logs_backend produce_logs
2024-06-04 21:18:46.036022 UTC: [Canister br5f7-7uaaa-aaaaa-qaaca-cai] counter: 2
()
```

Then, you can call the canister's logs, which in this case will return the same output that was logged to the command line:

```
dfx canister logs logs_backend
[0. 2024-06-04T21:14:25.882276Z]: counter: 0
[1. 2024-06-04T21:18:18.094003Z]: counter: 1
[2. 2024-06-04T21:18:46.036022Z]: counter: 2
```
