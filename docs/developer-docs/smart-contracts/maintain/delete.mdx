## Overview

If you want to permanently delete a specific <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> or all canisters for a project, you can use the [`dfx canister delete <canister-name>`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-delete) command.
