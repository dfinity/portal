# Delete

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

## Overview

If you want to permanently delete a specific <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> or all canisters for a project, you can use the [`dfx canister delete <canister-name>`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-delete) command.

Deleting a canister permanently removes its code and state. This action cannot be undone and once the canister is deleted, its ID cannot be reused. Before you can delete a canister, you must first stop the canister using [`dfx canister stop <canister-name>`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-stop) to clear any pending message requests or replies.
