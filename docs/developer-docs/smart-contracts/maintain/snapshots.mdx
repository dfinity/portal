# Snapshots

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

A <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> contains compiled Wasm code and data, such as the canister ID, settings, and Wasm memory. If a canister stops working as expected, traps, or simply needs to be rolled back to a previous version, the developer can use canister snapshots. Developers can take a snapshot of a stopped canister to save the canister's current stable memory, heap memory, data, and Wasm module. This snapshot can be loaded at a later date, rolling the canister back to the code and data saved within that snapshot.

:::info
Canister snapshots are supported in `dfx` version 0.23.0 and newer.
:::

## Creating a snapshot

To create a snapshot, first the canister must be stopped. Then, use the `dfx canister snapshot create` command:

```
dfx canister stop <canister-name>
dfx canister snapshot create <canister-name>
```

Only a controller of a canister can take a snapshot or roll a canister back to a snapshot.

:::info
Currently, only one snapshot per canister can be saved. Taking another snapshot of a canister that already has a snapshot saved will overwrite the previous snapshot.
:::

:::info
To take a snapshot of a canister on the mainnet, include the flag `--network ic` in the two commands shown above.
:::

The canister snapshot ID will be returned:

```
Created a new snapshot of canister hello_backend. Snapshot ID: 0000000000000000800000000010000a0101
```

This ID can be used to load the snapshot at a later time. To list all snapshots saved for a canister, use the command:

```
dfx canister snapshot list <canister-name>
```

The snapshot ID, snapshot size, and timestamp of when the snapshot was taken will be returned:

```
0000000000000000800000000010000a0101: 2.39MiB, taken at 2024-09-16 19:40:23 UTC
```

## Loading a snapshot

To load a saved snapshot, first the canister must be stopped. Then, use the `dfx canister snapshot load` command:

```
dfx canister stop <canister-name>
dfx canister snapshot load <canister-name> <snapshot-id>
```

:::info
To load a snapshot on the mainnet, include the flag `--network ic` in the two commands shown above.
:::

Loading a snapshot will replace the canister's current code and data with the snapshot code and data. Any new data that was added to the canister after the snapshot was taken will be deleted.

## Deleting snapshots

To delete a saved snapshot, use the command:

```
dfx canister snapshot delete <canister-name> <snapshot-id>
```

:::info
To delete a snapshot on the mainnet, include the flag `--network ic` in the command shown above.
