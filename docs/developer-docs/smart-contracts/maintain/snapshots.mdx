# Snapshots

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

A <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> contains compiled Wasm code and data, such as the canister ID, settings, and Wasm memory. If a canister stops working as expected, traps, or simply needs to be rolled back to a previous version, the developer can use canister snapshots. Developers can take a snapshot of a stopped canister to save the canister's current stable memory, heap memory, data, and Wasm module. This snapshot can be loaded at a later date, rolling the canister back to the code and data saved within that snapshot.

:::info
Canister snapshots are supported in `dfx` version 0.23.0 and newer.
:::

## Creating a snapshot

To create a snapshot, first the canister must be stopped. Then, use the [`dfx canister snapshot create <canister-name>`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-snapshot-create) command:

```
dfx canister stop <canister-name>
dfx canister snapshot create <canister-name>
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
Created a new snapshot of canister <canister-name>. Snapshot ID: 0000000000000000800000000010000a0101
```

</details>

Only a controller of a canister can take a snapshot or roll a canister back to a snapshot.

:::info
Currently, only one snapshot per canister can be saved. Taking another snapshot of a canister that already has a snapshot saved will overwrite the previous snapshot.

To take a snapshot of a canister on the mainnet, include the flag `--network ic` in the two commands shown above.
:::


The snapshot ID can be used to load the snapshot at a later time. To list all snapshots saved for a canister, use the command [`dfx canister snapshot list <canister-name>`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-snapshot-list):

```
dfx canister snapshot list <canister-name>
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```

```

</details>

## Loading a snapshot

To load a saved snapshot, first the canister must be stopped. Then, use the [`dfx canister snapshot load <canister-name> <snapshot-id>`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-snapshot-load) command:

```
dfx canister stop <canister-name>
dfx canister snapshot load <canister-name> <snapshot-id>
```

Loading a snapshot will replace the canister's current code and data with the snapshot code and data. Any new data that was added to the canister after the snapshot was taken will be deleted.

## Deleting snapshots

To delete a saved snapshot, use the command [`dfx canister snapshot delete <canister-name> <snapshot-id>`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-snapshot-delete)

```
dfx canister snapshot delete <canister-name> <snapshot-id>
```
