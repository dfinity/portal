# History

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

The Internet Computer tracks the history of a deployed <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> through the canister's Wasm module hashes and controller changes. This tracking provides insight into the canister's history, such as what code has been used to run the canister, and which controller deployed that code.

Viewing a canister's history can be important in use cases such as:

- Verifying that a canister's controller has not maliciously modified the code.

- Verifying that a canister's controller does not maliciously change the list of controllers for the canister. For example, if a canister's controller list only displays the governance canister as the current controller, users can trust that the canister's code has not been maliciously altered.

## How canister history works

Canister history was introduced and released by the NNS DAO proposal [122617](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122617).

Canister history information is made available via inter-canister calls made to the `canister_info` method of the management canister, using a canister's ID as an argument for the call. A canister's history stores the 20 most recent changes to the canister, including the canister's creation, Wasm module installations, reinstallations, upgrades, and changes to the list of canister controllers. It is important to note that since only the 20 most recent changes are stored, this feature cannot be used for auditing canisters that are frequently changed within a short period of time.

:::info
Note that canister history is only available for changes that have happened since this feature was rolled out on 023-06-05, 9:47:46 AM UTC, across all <GlossaryTooltip>subnets</GlossaryTooltip>.

You can read more about this feature on the [developer forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/canister-history-on-the-ic/21745).

## Canister history example

The following is an example of a Rust canister that displays the canister history feature and its functionality. This code includes in-line comments that document the different features and functions relating to canister history.

```rust

    CanisterInfoRequest, CanisterInfoResponse,
};

/// Traps if the canister_info management call is rejected (in particular, if the principal does not characterize a canister).
