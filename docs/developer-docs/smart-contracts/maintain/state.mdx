## Overview

After you deploy a canister, it can begin receiving and processing requests from users and from other canisters. Canisters that are available to send requests and receive replies are considered in be in a **Running** state.

Although canisters are normally placed in the Running state by default, there are cases where you might want to temporarily or permanently stop a canister. For example, you might want to stop a canister before upgrading it. Stopping a canister helps to ensure proper handling of any messages that are in progress and need to either run to completion or be rolled back. You might also want to stop a canister to clear its message queue cleanly as a prerequisite to deleting the canister.

You can check the current status of all canisters or a specified canister by running the `dfx canister status` command. For example, to see the status for all canisters running on the local canister execution environment, you would run the following command:

    dfx canister status --all

This command returns output similar to the following if canisters are currently running:

    Canister status_check's status is Running.
    Canister status_check_assets's status is Running.

You can stop canisters that are currently running by running the `dfx canister stop` command.

    dfx canister stop --all

This command displays output similar to the following:

    Stopping code for canister status_check, with canister_id 75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
    Stopping code for canister status_check_assets, with canister_id cxeji-wacaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q

If you were to rerun the `dfx canister status` command, you might see a status of `Stopped` indicating that there were no pending messages that needed to processed or a status of `Stopping` indicating that there were messages in-flight that needed to be addressed.

To restart a canister-for example, after a successful canister upgrade—you can run the `dfx canister start` command. For example, to restart all of the canisters, you would run the following command:

    dfx canister start --all

This command displays output similar to the following:

    Starting code for canister status_check, with canister_id 75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
    Starting code for canister status_check_assets, with canister_id cxeji-wacaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
