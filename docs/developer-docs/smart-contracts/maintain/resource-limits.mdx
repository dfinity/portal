# Resource limits

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

## Overview

The Internet Computer uses WebAssembly as the platform for executing messages of smart contracts.
Since WebAssembly is [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), it can express different kinds of computations including non-terminating computations.
The Internet Computer protects against non-terminating computations by limiting the number of WebAssembly instructions and other resources per message execution.
The limits depend on the message type as shown in the following table.

## Resource constraints and limits

## Performance limits

The block rate varies from 0.75 blocks per second to 1.5 blocks per second depending on the subnet and the number of nodes in the subnet.

Up to 1000 messages can be included in a block.
Since ICP decouples message reception from message execution, the messages included in a block are not guaranteed to be executed in the same block.
Messages for different canisters maybe executed in parallel on multiple threads.
ICP currently has 4 execution threads and each thread can execute up to 1000 messages.
Another limiting factor in execution throughput is the number of executed Wasm instructions.
ICP currently targets 2B instructions per block.

## Additional notes

The expiration time of an ingress message is specified by the [agent](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/off-chain/agents/overview) making the request, and can be up to 5 minutes.

The Internet Computer Protocol may reject WebAssembly modules for reasons such that:

- They declare more than 50_000 functions.
- They declare more than 1_000 globals.
- They declare a function with more than 1_000_000 Wasm instructions.
- They declare more than 16 exported custom sections (the custom section names with prefix icp:).
- The number of all exported functions called `canister_update <name>` or `canister_query <name>` exceeds 1_000.
- The sum of `<name>` lengths in all exported functions called `canister_update <name>` or `canister_query <name>` exceeds 20_000.
- The total size of the exported custom sections exceeds 1MiB.

More information regarding these restrictions can be found in the [Internet Computer interface specification](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-module).
