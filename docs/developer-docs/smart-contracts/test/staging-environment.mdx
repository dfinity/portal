# Staging environment

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

Having a separate deployment environment available where features can be end-to-end tested before they get deployed to the production environment can be helpful. While local deployments mirror the live mainnet as closely as possible, it is not the same. The local instance only runs as a single subnet. If you want to test <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip> of two different <GlossaryTooltip>subnets</GlossaryTooltip> connecting to each other, you cannot do this locally. Other benefits of using a staging environment include being able to test an integration with other services, deployment workflows, and estimating costs before setting a feature live.

## Setting up a staging environment

In a staging environment it is possible to run any `dfx` command that would otherwise take `--network ic` but using `--network myStaging` instead. `myStaging` can be replaced with any other name, except the three reserved ones: `ic`, `local`, and `playground`.

Networks are defined in two ways: assumed and explicitly configured. dfx only contains the `ic` network as an assumed environment. The flag `--network ic` can be used to run any command on the mainnet.

All other networks are explicitly configured in `dfx.json`. The `"networks"` section should contain at least the `local` network, which gets chosen by default if no other network is specified with the `--network` flag.

## Network definition

To add a staging network named `myStaging` to `dfx.json`, add this code under `"networks"` in your `dfx.json`:

``` json
"myStaging": {
    "providers": [
        "https://icp0.io"
    ],
    "type": "persistent"
}
```

This value for `"providers"` tells `dfx` where to connect to the network. It is identical to the one in the hard-coded `ic` network.
The type `persistent` tells `dfx` that the canisters on this network will stay there and the canister identifiers will be saved in the `canister_ids.json` file.

### Configuring a wallet

If you are using a cycles wallet, the cycles wallet for each network is stored separately. The newly created `myStaging` network has no wallet configured yet.

:::caution
Please note that the cycles wallet will be removed from dfx in a future release.

It is recommended to use the cycles ledger instead.
:::

To use the same cycles wallet as on the main `ic` network, first make sure the correct identity is set by running the command:

```bash
dfx identity use <identity name>
```

Then, read the `ic` network's currently configured wallet using:

```bash
dfx identity get-wallet --network ic
```

Set the wallet for the newly defined network with the command:

```bash
dfx identity set-wallet <wallet id> --network myStaging
```

These commands can be used together, such as:

```bash
dfx identity set-wallet "$(dfx identity get-wallet --network ic)" --network myStaging
```

If you prefer to use a separate cycles wallet for the staging environment, follow the instructions in the step 'Creating a cycles wallet' in the [deploying to the mainnet guide](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/mainnet).
