# PocketIC

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

PocketIC is a lightweight, deterministic testing solution for programmatic testing of <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip>.
It seamlessly integrates with existing testing infrastructure, such as `cargo test`, and runs as a standalone binary that doesn't require additional containers or virtual machines.
Currently, PocketIC is supported on macOS and Linux host systems.

While there are other options for testing canisters, they may come with pitfalls such as:

- Installing and testing canisters on the mainnet provides the 'real' workflow experience, but will cost developers real cycles.

- Testing using the local <GlossaryTooltip>replica</GlossaryTooltip> provided by `dfx` allows for testing on a single IC node, but there is no cross-net or multi-subnet functionality. Testing with the local replica is not deterministic, and it is rather heavyweight. Additionally, testing with `dfx` can be complex, slow, and require additional boilerplate code to get working.

PocketIC is designed to remedy these pitfalls, resulting in a testing environment that provides the following benefits:

- Deterministic: Synchronous control over the local canister execution environment. PocketIC removes non-deterministic parts of the replica to make tests fully reproducible.

- Lightweight: Only provides the necessary components, and strips away the consensus and networking layers.

- Concurrent and independent IC instances: Enabling tests to run in parallel

- Multi-language support: Currently supports Rust, Python and JavaScript/TypeScript, but supports integration with any language that is written against the PocketIC REST-API.

- Versatile: Allows for fine-grained control over the canister by providing the ability to set stable memory, control how time passes, and other testing environment variables.

- Support for Xnet calls and multiple subnets.

:::caution
While PocketIC can support integration with any language, Rust and Python will be covered in this guide.

## PocketIC Rust

To use PocketIC, the latest PocketIC server binary must be downloaded from the PocketIC repo. [Download the latest version for macOS or Linux systems](https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic?tab=readme-ov-file#download-the-pocketic-server).

:::info
PocketIC is currently not natively supported on Windows systems.
:::

The PocketIC binary can be left in your working directory or you can specify the path to the binary by setting the `POCKET_IC_BIN` environmental variable.

Add PocketIC Rust do your project with the command:

```bash
cargo add pocket-ic --dev
```

PocketIC can be imported into your project with the code:

```rust
use pocket_ic::PocketIc;
```

Then, in your code you can create a new PocketIC instance with the code:

```rust
let pic = PocketIc::new();
```

### Single canister testing on a single subnet

[View an example of testing a canister on a single subnet](https://crates.io/crates/pocket-ic).

### Multi-subnet testing

Versions of PocketIC `v2.0.0` and newer support multi-subnet testing. Multi-subnet testing allows for simulating multiple, different types of subnets locally. For example, to create an IC instance with an NNS subnet and two application subnets, use the code:

```rust
let pic = PocketIcBuilder::new()
    .with_nns_subnet()
    .with_application_subnet()
    .with_application_subnet()
    .build();
```

Then, to target the NNS subnet to create a canister, use the code:

```rust
let nns_sub = pic.topology().get_nns_subnet().unwrap();
let nns_can_id = pic.create_canister_on_subnet(..., nns_sub);
```

To test one of the application subnets and install a canister, use the code:

```rust
let app_sub_2 = pic.topology().get_app_subnets()[1];
let app_can_id = pic.create_canister_on_subnet(..., app_sub_2);
pic.install_canister(app_can_id, ...);
```

To create a canister with a specific `canister_id` on a named subnet, in this example the NNS subnet, use the code:

```rust
let ledger_canister_id = Principal::from_text("ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai").unwrap();
pic.create_canister_with_id(..., ledger_canister_id).unwrap();
pic.install_canister(ledger_canister_id, ...);
```

Possible types of subnets include:

- Generic system subnets.

- Generic application subnets.

- Named subnets with canister ID ranges like on mainnet, such as the NNS, SNS, II, Bitcoin, and Fiduciary subnets.

For a larger, more complex example that uses cross canister calls on two different subnets, see the full code [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/HEAD/packages/pocket-ic/tests/tests.rs#L57).

## PocketIC Python

To use PocketIC, the latest PocketIC server binary must be downloaded from the PocketIC repo. [Download the latest version for macOS or Linux systems](https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic#download-the-pocketic-server).

The PocketIC binary can be left in your working directory or you can specify the path to the binary by setting the `POCKET_IC_BIN` environmental variable.

Then, run the following command to install PocketIC:

```bash
pip3 install pocket-ic
```

To import PocketIC into your Python code, use the line:

```python
from pocket_ic import PocketIC
```

### Create a canister with <GlossaryTooltip>cycles</GlossaryTooltip> and call the canister

[View an example of how to create a canister with cycles, then call the canister](https://pypi.org/project/pocket-ic/).

### Make a call directly with a canister object

```python
my_canister = pic.create_and_install_canister_with_candid(...)
```

### Call your canister methods using the native Python syntax

```python
response = my_canister.greeting()
assert(response == 'Hello, PocketIC!')
```

### Single canister testing on a single subnet

[View a complete example of testing a single canister on a single subnet](https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic-py/blob/main/examples/counter_canister/counter_canister_test.py).

To see more examples and run them locally, clone the [PocketIC Python repo](https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic-py), then run the following command, replacing the example name with the example you'd like to run. For example, to run the `counter_canister` example, use the command:

```bash
python3 examples/counter_canister/counter_canister_test.py
```
