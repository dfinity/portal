# System canisters

## Overview

System canisters are canisters that provide a necessary function to the ICP network. These canisters are controlled by the NNS and are upgraded via NNS proposals. These canisters have static canister IDs that projects can reference. One common example of a system canister that is referenced by projects is the Internet Identity canister.

## Using system canisters

Developers can use system canisters in their project to integrate services into their dapp or enable functionality that requires data from a system canister.

For example, Internet Identity can be integrated into a dapp to provide user authentication service to the project. Internet Identity is commonly integrated into a dapp through the [`dfx deps`](/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/pulling-canister-dependencies) command. `dfx deps` allows you to pull a system canister into your local project for testing.

For other projects calls can be made to system canisters to obtain information, such as DeFi projects making calls to the ICP index to obtain information about ICP transactions or price.
