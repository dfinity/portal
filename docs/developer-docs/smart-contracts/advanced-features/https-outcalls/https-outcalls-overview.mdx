# Make an HTTP request

## Overview

Canister smart contracts can make a request to a URL using [HTTPS outcalls](https://internetcomputer.org/https-outcalls). HTTPS outcalls can be used to directly obtain off-chain data or interact with off-chain systems, such as Web 2.0 services or enterprise IT infrastructure.

HTTPS outcalls enable a wide range of applications. For example, oracle services can directly integrate with ICP in a trustless manner, and dapps can provide user notifications or anything else that requires communication with servers on the Internet.

## How it works

For detailed information on how it works, please refer to the [HTTPS outcalls - How it works](/docs/current/references/https-outcalls-how-it-works).

## How to make a request

For detailed information on how to utilize this feature, please refer to the [HTTPS outcalls - How to use](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/https-outcalls/https-outcalls-how-to-use) page.

The documentation includes examples demonstrating how to make the following types of requests:
- [GET Request](./https-outcalls-get.mdx)
- [POST Request](./https-outcalls-post.mdx)

## Examples

Refer to the following examples of HTTP outcalls implementations in canister smart contracts:

- Fetch price information for DeFi protocols using the [Exchange Rate Canister](https://github.com/dfinity/exchange-rate-canister)
- Communicate with other chains using the [EVM RPC Canister](https://github.com/internet-computer-protocol/evm-rpc-canister)
- Fetch information about Bitcoin Ordinals and Bitcoin Meta-Protocols using the [Ordinals Canister](https://github.com/sardariuss/ordinals_canister)
