# Async code and inter-canister calls

## Overview

In programming, the [async/await pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Async/await) is a syntactic feature of many programming languages that allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a similar way to an ordinary synchronous function.


On ICP, `async/await` is useful in the context of inter-canister calls. Inter-canister calls cannot be handled synchronously (as the two canisters
interacting might not even be in the same subnet), so when a canister sends a call to another, it will have to wait until a response comes back
before it can continue processing the call it received.


The `async/await` pattern makes this look straightforward, as the developer can write code as if processing happens sequentially and the call to
the callee is handled “synchronously”. However, given ICP's message passing model, one has to be careful in case there are [concurrent calls that
message executions can interleave](/docs/current/references/message-execution-properties) as these can lead to inconsistencies if they are not anticipated.

## Overview of language runtime for asynchronous code


Most languages implement asynchronous code through constructs that they typically call [futures](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/)
([promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) in Javascript). A future is a representation
of an eventual value produced by some asynchronous computation. Typically, a future is modeled to have different states depending on whether the
result of the asynchronous computation is ready or not. The language runtime can poll the future to learn about its result. As long as the result
is not ready, the code will typically yield execution and the future will be polled again later.


In order to implement inter-canister calls on ICP, there would need to be a future which, once created, takes care of calling
[the respective system APIs](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-call) to make the call and will
become ready once the response from the calling canister is received. The language runtime can poll the future once it's ready and retrieve the
result of the inter-canister call.


## Inter-canister calls


Let's look at an example where two canisters interact with each other. In the following example, canister A calls into canister B.


```
/// Canister A
async fn foo() {
  do_work();
  call(canister_b, 'bar').await;
  do_more_work(res);
}

/// Canister B
fn bar() {
  do_some_more_work();
}
```


When canister A calls B, a future that represents the result of the call is created. The future calls [the system API](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-call)
to enqueue the outgoing call. The future is not ready yet as it needs the response from canister B, so the code will yield and the message
execution for canister A will stop at the point before `do_more_work`.


Once the response from B is delivered, the future will be ready and contain the result of the call. Once polled (by the language's runtime when
the callback handler is invoked) it will pass the result to canister A and execution can proceed with the remaining part (i.e. `do_more_work`).


## Asynchronous functions


In the following example, another call is added to a local function to canister A before making the inter-canister call to canister B.


```
/// Canister A
async fn foo() {
  baz().await;
  call(canister_b, 'bar').await;
  do_more_work(res);
}

async fn baz() {
  do_local_work();
}

/// Canister B
fn bar() {
  do_some_more_work();
}
```


When `baz().await` is called a future is created to represent its result. The result can actually be immediately available since there's only
local computation (i.e. no inter-canister call involved) happening in `baz`. So, the future can return a result directly when polled and message
execution can still proceed up to the point where the call to canister B is made (similar to the example from the previous section).

The above behavior is one possibility depending on how the language runtime handles the `async/await` pattern. Rust follows this approach.
In contrast, Motoko takes another approach where every async/await call will be converted to an inter-canister call, more specifically a self-call
in case a local function is called. This means that in Motoko `foo` would be split across 3 message executions -- the first would be until `baz` is
called, the second until canister B is called and the final one until the end of the function body.
