# Composite queries

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview
The Internet Computer Protocol supports two types of messages: updates and queries. An update message is executed on all nodes and persists canister state changes. A query message discards state changes and typically executes on a single node. It is possible to execute a query message as an update. In such a case, the query still discards the state changes, but the execution happens on all nodes and the result of execution goes through consensus. This “query-as-update” execution mode is also known as replicated query.

An update can call other updates and queries. However a query cannot make any calls, which can hinder development of scalable decentralized applications, especially those that shard data across multiple canisters.

Composite queries solve this problem. You can add composite queries to your canister using the following annotations:

 * Candid: `composite_query`
 * Motoko: `composite query`
 * Rust: `#[query(composite = true)]`

Users and the client-side JavaScript code can invoke a composite query endpoint of a canister using the same query URL for existing regular queries. In contrast to regular queries, a composite query can call other composite and regular queries. Due to limitations of the current implementation, composite queries have two restrictions:

| Query | Update | Composite query |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Cannot call other queries or composite queries| Can call other updates and queries ; Cannot call composite queries| Can call other queries and composite queries |
| Can be called as an update | Cannot be called as a query | Cannot be called as an update |
| Can call canisters on another subnet | Can call canisters on another subnet | Cannot call canisters on another subnet |


Composite queries were enabled in the following releases:

## Sample code
As an example, consider a partitioned key-value store, where a single frontend does the following for a `put` and `get` call:

- First, determines the ID of the data partition canister that holds the value with the given key.
- Then, makes a call into the `get` or `put` function of that canister and parses the result.
