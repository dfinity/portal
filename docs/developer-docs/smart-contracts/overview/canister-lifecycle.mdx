# Canister lifecycle

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

## Write

The ICP accepts and executes <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> code in the WebAssembly (Wasm) binary format.
Usually, developers write code in a higher-level language and then compile the code into a Wasm binary that can be deployed into a canister.

[Learn more about writing canister code](../write/overview.mdx).

## Create

A developer can create an empty canister on ICP by calling the system canister.
It can be done using [`dfx canister create`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-create) in the command line or the [<GlossaryTooltip>NNS</GlossaryTooltip> frontend dapp](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/using-the-nns-dapp/nns-app-quickstart#deploying-and-managing-canisters-from-the-nns-dapp) in the browser.
The developer can specify the initial canister settings and choose the target <GlossaryTooltip>subnet</GlossaryTooltip>.
Once the canister is created, the developer gets its canister ID and becomes the controller of the canister.

## Compile

Once an empty canister has been created, the canister's code must be compiled into a Wasm binary using [`dfx build`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-build).

[Learn more about compiling code into Wasm](../compile.mdx).

## Install

The next step after writing the code, creating a canister, and compiling the code is installing the code into the canister.
This can be done by calling the `install_code` endpoint of the system canister and passing the canister ID and the Wasm binary to it.
The [`dfx canister install`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-install) command is used for making this call.

</div>

## Deploy

Once a canister has an installed Wasm binary, it can be deployed to the local, playground, or mainnet environments with [`dfx deploy`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-deploy).

[Learn more about deploying canisters](../deploy/overview.mdx).

## Call

After deployment, the canister accepts and processes messages (calls) from users and other canisters.
Only the public endpoints of the canister can be called.
These endpoints correspond to exported Wasm functions that are annotated with `canister_update` or `canister_query` in their names.

## Maintain

Certain system operations that change the state of the <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> can be performed only by the controllers of the canister.
The most important operation is upgrading the canister by installing a different Wasm binary.
In the initial stages of development, the canister is usually controlled by its developer, which allows the developer to iterate quickly.
As the canister becomes mature and production ready, the control over it could move to a DAO in order to make the canister secure and trustworthy.
[Learn more about different types of controllers](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/control).

Since ICP uses a reverse gas model, the canister pays for its execution, storage, and other operations with <GlossaryTooltip>cycles</GlossaryTooltip>.
This means that controllers and/or users of the canister have to ensure that the canister does not run out of cycles.
If the canister runs out of cycles, it will be uninstalled by removing its Wasm binary and its storage.

If the canister is no longer used or needed, a controller of the canister can delete it.
ICP guarantees that the canister ID will not be reused for another canister.
