# Call overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

To interact with a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>'s methods, there are two primary types of calls that can be used: update calls and query calls.

**Update calls** can make modifications to a canister's state, while **query calls** cannot.

A query method can be called as both an update and a query, whereas update methods can be called only as an update.

| Update calls | Query Calls |
| :----------: | :------: |
| Slow (1-2s) | Fast (200-400ms) |
| Can modify state | Can't modify state |
| Goes through consensus | Does not go through consensus |
| Synchronous response | Synchronous response |
| Executed on all nodes of a subnet | Executed on a single node |


See the reference on [ingress messages](/docs/current/references/ingress-messages) for a more technical discussion of this topic.

## Update calls

Update calls are executed on all nodes of a <GlossaryTooltip>subnet</GlossaryTooltip> since the result of the call must go through consensus. This makes them slower than query calls. They are submitted asynchronously and answered synchronously.

:::danger
Update calls do not go through consensus on the local replica.
:::

### Making update calls

To make a update call to a canister, use the [`dfx canister call`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-call) command with the `--update` flag:


- `dfx canister call --update <canister_name> <method_name>` : Make an update call to a canister deployed locally. The local replica must be running to create a canister locally. Start it with `dfx start --background`.

- `dfx canister call --update <canister_name> <method_name> --network=playground`: Make an update call to a canister deployed on the playground. Making update calls to canisters deployed on the playground is free, but canisters are temporary and will be removed after 20 minutes.

- `dfx canister call --update <canister_name> <method_name> --network=ic`: Make an update call to a canister deployed on the mainnet. Update calls will cost [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/gas-cost).

## Query calls

Query calls, also referred to as non-replicated queries, are executed on a single node and return a synchronous response. Since they execute on a single node, they do not go through consensus and can be much faster than update calls.

### Making query calls

To make a query call to a canister, use the [`dfx canister call`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-call) command with the `--query` flag:

- `dfx canister call --query <canister_name> <method_name>`: Make a query call to a canister deployed locally. The local replica must be running to create a canister locally. Start it with `dfx start --background`.

- `dfx canister call --query <canister_name> <method_name> --network=playground`: Make a query call to a canister deployed on the playground. Query calls are free, but canisters are temporary and will be removed after 20 minutes.

- `dfx canister call --query <canister_name> <method_name> --network=ic`: Make a query call to a canister deployed on the mainnet. Query calls are free.

:::caution
The downside of query calls is that the response is not trusted since it's coming from a single node. An update call or a [certified query](#certified-queries) should be used for security-critical calls.

## ICP message executions

Calls to canisters can be initiated by end users or other canisters. A call is processed by the canister in one or more message executions. A message execution is a set of consecutive instructions that ICP executes on behalf of the canister.

Typically, a call is processed within a single message execution unless there are calls to other canisters involved, in which case the call will be split across several message executions.

[Learn more about the properties of ICP message executions.](/docs/current/references/execution-errors)

## Other types of calls

### Composite queries

Composite queries are query calls that can call other queries on the same <GlossaryTooltip>subnet</GlossaryTooltip>. They can only be invoked by end users and not by other canisters.

### Certified queries

Certified queries use certified variables to prove the authenticity of a piece of data that comes along with the query's response. Certified variables can be set via an update call, then read via a query call.

### Replicated queries

Replicated queries, also referred to as the "query-as-update" execution model, are query calls executed as updates. The query still discards the state changes, but execution happens on all subnet nodes and the results go through consensus.

### Inter-canister calls

Inter-canister calls are used to make calls between different canisters. An inter-canister call involves two messages: a request from the caller to the callee along with a response that the callee will return to the caller.

### Authorized calls

An authorized call on ICP refers to a call to a canister that can only be made by a principal (a user or another canister) that has the necessary permissions to perform the call. For example, only a controller of a canister can call the canister's `install_code` function.

Authorized calls that return a value of `()` indicate that the function was successful, but may not take an argument or return a meaningful value. If an authorized call is unsuccessful, it will return an error.

## Making calls with IDLs

On the protocol level, calls on ICP use blobs to describe arguments and results passed to and returned from canisters. It's typically easier to use an [interface description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) (IDL) to define a canister's interfaces that can be called by end users or other canisters.

While any IDL can be used for this purpose, most canisters on ICP use [Candid](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/candid/candid-concepts), a specialized IDL that is developed for ICP.

## Errors related to calling canisters

Common errors related to calling canisters include:

- [Method not found](/docs/current/references/execution-errors#method-not-found).

- [Calling a system API from the wrong mode](/docs/current/references/execution-errors#calling-a-system-api-from-the-wrong-mode).

- [Canister made a call with too large method name](/docs/current/references/execution-errors#canister-made-a-call-with-too-large-method-name).

- [Canister made a call with too large payload](/docs/current/references/execution-errors#canister-made-a-call-with-too-large-payload).

- [Canister made a call with too long timeout](/docs/current/references/execution-errors#canister-made-a-call-with-too-long-timeout).
