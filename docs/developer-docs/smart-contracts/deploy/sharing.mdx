# Sharing links to dapps

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

Once a dapp has been deployed to the mainnet, the <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> serves the dapp's frontend via a URL. This URL can be shared with anyone, allowing them to view and interact with your dapp without you needing to configure domain names, DNS records, or other networking configurations.

## Sharing links to dapps

When a canister is deployed to the mainnet (with a command such as `dfx deploy --network ic`), the canister's ID will be returned in the output. For example, when deploying a project with two canisters, the output will resemble:

```

Deployed canisters.
```

There are two canisters deployed, identified by their ids:

```
"poll_backend" canister created on network "ic" with canister id: "5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai"
...
"poll_frontend" canister created on network "ic" with canister id: "5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai"
```

You can use the following URL format to access your canister in the web browser:

```
https://<canister_id>.icp0.io
```

For example, to access a canister with a canister id of `5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai`:

```
https://5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai.icp0.io
```

If you are sharing a link to a frontend (asset) canister, the frontend of the dapp will be displayed.

If you are sharing a link to a backend canisters, the [CandidUI](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/candid/candid-concepts) will be displayed.
