# Deploy overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

After you have built a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>, you can
deploy it to:

- <strong>The local canister execution environment</strong> on your machine where
  no tokens or cycles are required
- <strong>The playground on the mainnet</strong>, a testnet-like sandbox
  environment. No tokens or cycles are required to deploy and run your canister
  smart contract, but it will be removed after 20 minutes.
- <strong>Mainnet</strong> for production use. This deployment method will require
  cycles.

This page will guide you through all 3 deployment methods.

:::info
This page details using the `dfx deploy` command, which does several processes in the background, including:

- [Creating each canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/create) listed in the `dfx.json` file.

- [Compiling the code](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/compile) for each canister into a Wasm module.

- [Installing the Wasm module](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/install) into each canister. 

- Deploying the canisters to the deployment endpoint of choice (local, playground, mainnet).
:::

## Testnets

Most blockchain networks have separate testnets that allow smart contract
developers to test their projects in a production-like environment at
significantly lower cost than on the mainnet. Because the execution of canisters is
fairly cheap on ICP, and ICP smart contracts can be upgraded once deployed, there is no testnet for ICP.
Developers are encouraged to test their canister smart contracts locally or directly on the mainnet.

However, the [playground](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy-and-manage) sandbox environment can be used as a testnet-like deployment option. It does not require cycles or tokens to deploy and operate a canister, but it has limitations, and canisters will be automatically removed after 20 minutes.

For the majority of developers, the playground option can be used for most workflows, as will be demonstrated below. For more advanced developers and use cases, there are two possible options for a testnet-like environment:

- [Private testnets](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/deploy/custom-testnets): Developers can deploy their own custom instance of the playground on the mainnet, allowing for full customization of the playground's parameters.

- [Synthetic testnets](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/deploy/custom-testnets): The `dfx` named network feature can be used to create custom local networks that can be used for local testing segmented from other projects deployed locally.

## Deployment

Before you deploy your canister, open a new terminal and navigate to your project
directory. Verify the canisters you'd like to deploy are configured in the
project's `dfx.json` file.

:::info

Need to create a project? Check out the
[writing smart contracts](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/write-smart-contracts) sample
page for an example project.

An example `dfx.json` file can be found in the
[default project template document](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/write-smart-contracts).
:::

### Local deployment

Start the local canister execution environment:

```bash
dfx start
```

To deploy locally, use the command:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

### Deploying to playground

To deploy to the playground, use the command:

```bash
dfx deploy --playground
```

### Deploying to mainnet

To deploy to the mainnet, use the command:

```bash
dfx deploy --network ic
```

Deploying canisters to the mainnet will cost cycles. [Learn more about cycles and how to acquire them](/docs/developer-docs/getting-started/tokens-and-cycles.mdx).


## Sharing links to canisters

Once a dapp has been deployed to the mainnet, each canister can be accessed via a public URL. This URL can be shared with anyone, allowing them to view and interact with your dapp without you needing to configure domain names, DNS records, or other networking configurations.

You can use the following URL format to access a canister in the web browser:

```
https://<canister_id>.icp0.io
```

For example, to access a canister with a canister ID of `5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai`:

```
https://5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai.icp0.io
```

:::info
If you are sharing a link to a frontend (asset) canister, the frontend of the dapp will be displayed.

If you are sharing a link to a backend canisters, the [CandidUI](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/candid/candid-concepts) will be displayed.
:::

### Deploying specific canisters

The `deploy` command deploys all canisters configured in your `dfx.json` file.
To deploy just one canister, specify the canister's name:

```bash
dfx deploy hello_backend ## Deploy locally
dfx deploy hello_backend --playground ## Deploy to the playground
dfx deploy hello_backend --network ic ## Deploy to the mainnet
```

## Use a custom Motoko version with `dfx deploy`

To use a custom Motoko version with `dfx deploy`, export the following
environment variable that indicates which Motoko base version you'd like `dfx`
to use:

```bash
DFX_MOC_PATH="$(vessel bin)/moc" dfx deploy
```

## Setting a canister's init arguments

You can set a canister's init arguments when the canister is deployed by passing
the `--argument` flag in either the `dfx install` or `dfx deploy` commands:

```bash
dfx canister install <CANISTER_NAME> --argument "(arg in candid)"
```

```bash
dfx deploy <CANISTER_NAME> --argument "(arg in candid)"
```

If several arguments should be used, an argument file can be defined with the
`--argument-file` flag instead:

```bash
dfx deploy <CANISTER_NAME> --argument-file file.txt
```

Alternatively, init arguments can be set in `dfx.json` in `dfx` versions
`v0.17.0` and newer:

```json title="dfx.json"
"canisters": {
    "hello_backend": {
      "candid": "src/hello_backend/hello_backend.did",
      "package": "hello_backend",
      "type": "rust",
      "init_arg": "(arg in candid)"
    },
 }
```

If an init argument is set in `dfx.json` and set with the CLI command, the
argument set in the CLI command is used.

## Setting tasks to execute once a canister has been deployed

For certain workflows, it may be important to have a canister execute a task or
call as soon as the canister is deployed or started. For this workflow, using
[timers](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/periodic-tasks) can be useful.

Here is an example:

<AdornedTabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

This example creates a periodic timer that gets called immediately after the
canister starts:

```motoko
import Time "mo:base/Time";
import Timer "mo:base/Timer";
import Nat64 "mo:base/Nat64";
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";

actor {
    system func timer(setGlobalTimer : Nat64 -> ()) : async () {
      let next = Nat64.fromIntWrap(Time.now()) + 20_000_000_000;
      setGlobalTimer(next); // absolute time in nanoseconds
      Debug.print("Tick!");
    }
}
```

You can learn more in the
[Motoko Timer library documentation](/docs/current/motoko/main/base/Timer).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

This example creates a periodic timer that gets called immediately after the
canister starts:

```rust
#[ic_cdk::init]
fn init(timer_interval_secs: u64) {
    let interval = std::time::Duration::from_secs(timer_interval_secs);
    ic_cdk::println!("Starting a periodic task with interval {interval:?}");
    ic_cdk_timers::set_timer_interval(interval, || {
        COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    });
}
```

</TabItem>

<AdornedTab value={"typescript"} label="TypeScript" endAdornment={<BetaChip />}>

This example creates a periodic timer that gets called immediately after the
canister starts:

```typescript
import { IDL, setTimer, update } from 'azle';

export default class {
    @init([], IDL.Nat64)
    createTimer(): bigint {
        const timerId = setTimer(1_000n, () =>
            console.log('timer callback called')
        );

        return timerId;
    }
}
```

</AdornedTab>

<AdornedTab value={"python"} label="Python" endAdornment={<BetaChip />}>

This example creates a periodic timer that gets called immediately after the
canister starts:

```python
from kybra import (
    blob,
    Duration,
    ic,
    query,
    Record,
    TimerId,
    update,
    void,
)

class TimerIds(Record):
    single: TimerId

@init
def set_timers(delay: Duration, interval: Duration) -> TimerIds:

    single_id = ic.set_timer(delay, one_time_timer_callback)

    return {
        "single": single_id,
    }

def one_time_timer_callback():
    ic.print("one_time_timer_callback called")
```

:::caution

Kybra canisters must be deployed from a Python virtual environment. [Learn more in the Kybra docs](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/python/).
