# Deploy overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

After you have built a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>, you can
deploy it to:

- <strong>The local canister execution environment</strong> on your machine where
  no tokens or cycles are required
- <strong>The playground on the mainnet</strong>, a testnet-like sandbox
  environment. No tokens or cycles are required to deploy and run your canister
  smart contract, but it will be removed after 20 minutes.
- <strong>Mainnet</strong> for production use. This deployment method will require
  cycles.

This page will guide you through all 3 deployment methods.

:::info
This page details using the `dfx deploy` command, which does several processes in the background, including:

- [Creating each canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/create) listed in the `dfx.json` file.

- [Compiling the code](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/compile) for each canister into a Wasm module.

- [Installing the Wasm module](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/install) into each canister. 

- Deploying the canisters to the deployment endpoint of choice (local, playground, mainnet).
:::

## Testnets

Most blockchain networks have separate testnets that allow smart contract
developers to test their projects in a production-like environment at
significantly lower cost than on the mainnet. Because the execution of canisters is
fairly cheap on ICP, and ICP smart contracts can be upgraded once deployed, there is no testnet for ICP.
Developers are encouraged to test their canister smart contracts locally or directly on the mainnet.

However, the [playground](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/testnet) sandbox environment can be used as a testnet-like deployment option. It does not require cycles or tokens to deploy and operate a canister, but it has limitations, and canisters will be automatically removed after 20 minutes.

For the majority of developers, the playground option can be used for most workflows, as will be demonstrated below. For more advanced developers and use cases, there are two possible options for a testnet-like environment:

- [Private testnets](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/deploy/custom-testnets): Developers can deploy their own custom instance of the playground on the mainnet, allowing for full customization of the playground's parameters.

- [Synthetic testnets](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/deploy/custom-testnets): The `dfx` named network feature can be used to create custom local networks that can be used for local testing segmented from other projects deployed locally.

## Deployment

Before you deploy your canister, open a new terminal and navigate to your project
directory. Verify the canisters you'd like to deploy are configured in the
project's `dfx.json` file.

:::info

Need to create a project? Check out the
[Hello, world!](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/hello-world) sample
project.

An example `dfx.json` file can be found in the
[default project template document](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/hello-world).
:::

### Local deployment

Start the local canister execution environment:

```
dfx start
```

To deploy locally, use the command:

```
dfx deploy
```

### Deploying to playground

To deploy to the playground, use the command:

```
dfx deploy --playground
```

### Deploying to mainnet

To deploy to the mainnet, use the command:

```
dfx deploy --network ic
```

Deploying canisters to the mainnet will cost cycles.
[Learn more about cycles and how to acquire them](/docs/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles-faucet.mdx).

### Deploying specific canisters

The `deploy` command deploys all canisters configured in your `dfx.json` file.
To deploy just one canister, specify the canister's name:

```
dfx deploy hello_backend ## Deploy locally
dfx deploy hello_backend --playground ## Deploy to the playground
dfx deploy hello_backend --network ic ## Deploy to the mainnet
```

## Use a custom Motoko version with `dfx deploy`

To use a custom Motoko version with `dfx deploy`, export the following
environment variable that indicates which Motoko base version you'd like `dfx`
to use:

```
DFX_MOC_PATH="$(vessel bin)/moc" dfx deploy
```

## Setting a canister's init arguments

You can set a canister's init arguments when the canister is deployed by passing
the `--argument` flag in either the `dfx install` or `dfx deploy` commands:

```
dfx canister install <CANISTER_NAME> --argument "(arg in candid)"
```

```
dfx deploy <CANISTER_NAME> --argument "(arg in candid)"
```

If several arguments should be used, an argument file can be defined with the
`--argument-file` flag instead:

```
dfx deploy <CANISTER_NAME> --argument-file file.txt
```

Alternatively, init arguments can be set in `dfx.json` in `dfx` versions
`v0.17.0` and newer:

```json
"canisters": {
    "hello_backend": {
      "candid": "src/hello_backend/hello_backend.did",
      "package": "hello_backend",
      "type": "rust",
      "init_arg": "(arg in candid)"
    },
 }
```

If an init argument is set in `dfx.json` and set with the CLI command, the
argument set in the CLI command is used.

## Setting tasks to execute once a canister has been deployed

For certain workflows, it may be important to have a canister execute a task or
call as soon as the canister is deployed or started. For this workflow, using
[timers](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/periodic-tasks) can be useful.

Here is an example:

<AdornedTabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

This example creates a periodic timer that gets called immediately after the
canister starts:

```motoko

system func timer(setGlobalTimer : Nat64 -> ()) : async () {
  let next = Nat64.fromIntWrap(Time.now()) + 20_000_000_000;
  setGlobalTimer(next); // absolute time in nanoseconds
  print("Tick!");
}
```

You can learn more in the
[Motoko Timer library documentation](/docs/current/motoko/main/base/Timer).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

This example creates a periodic timer that gets called immediately after the
canister starts:

```rust
#[ic_cdk::init]
fn init(timer_interval_secs: u64) {
    let interval = std::time::Duration::from_secs(timer_interval_secs);
    ic_cdk::println!("Starting a periodic task with interval {interval:?}");
    ic_cdk_timers::set_timer_interval(interval, || {
        COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    });
}
```

</TabItem>

<AdornedTab value={"typescript"} label="TypeScript" endAdornment={<BetaChip />}>

This example creates a periodic timer that gets called immediately after the
canister starts:

```typescript
import { IDL, setTimer, update } from 'azle';

export default class {
    @update([], IDL.Nat64)
    createTimer(): bigint {
        const timerId = setTimer(1_000n, () =>
            console.log('timer callback called')
        );

        return timerId;
    }
}
```

</AdornedTab>

<AdornedTab value={"python"} label="Python" endAdornment={<BetaChip />}>

This example creates a periodic timer that gets called immediately after the
canister starts:

```python
from kybra import (
    blob,
    Duration,
    ic,
    query,
    Record,
    TimerId,
    update,
    void,
)

class TimerIds(Record):
    single: TimerId

@update
def set_timers(delay: Duration, interval: Duration) -> TimerIds:

    single_id = ic.set_timer(delay, one_time_timer_callback)

    return {
        "single": single_id,
    }

def one_time_timer_callback():
    ic.print("one_time_timer_callback called")
```

:::caution

Kybra canisters must be deployed from a Python virtual environment. [Learn more in the Kybra docs](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/python/).
