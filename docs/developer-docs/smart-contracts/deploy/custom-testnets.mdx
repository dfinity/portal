# Custom testnets

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

ICP does not have a public testnet network that developers can use to deploy and test canister smart contracts because canisters deployed to the mainnet can be upgraded and changed, plus deployment costs are fairly low compared to other chains.

To provide a testnet-like environment, ICP has a smart contract [playground](https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.ic0.app/) network that can be used for small-scale, temporary testing. Canisters deployed to the playground are restricted to certain parameters. These limitations are:

- Cycle transfer instructions are silently ignored by the playground.
- Canisters can use at most 1GiB of memory.
- Canisters can call the management canister to manage itself without being the controller.
- Deployed canisters expire after 20 minutes. Upgrades to canisters reset this timer. When the timer runs out, the canister(s) will be uninstalled.
- Wasm files can't be gzipped.
- Wasm files will be analyzed to remove any potentially expensive or malicious operations.

For advanced developers and use cases that want to use a testnet environment without these restrictions, there are two options:

- **Private testnets**: Deploy your own instance of the playground, allowing you to control the playground settings, remove restrictions, and modify the canister pool. This option costs cycles, as you will need to fund your instance of the playground with cycles that will be used to fund canisters deployed to your playground.

- **Synthetic testnets**: Use the `dfx` named network feature to create a local network that is segmented away from the default local network created by `dfx`.

## Private testnet

To create a private testnet, you can create a custom instance of the playground. Using your own instance of the playground allows for extensive customization, such as:

- Enabling access control by restricting the playground's usage to only allow certain principals.

- Configuring more generous canister timeouts and the number of available cycles.

- Allowing some or all of the functions that the public playground does not allow, such as sending cycles to other canisters.

Using a custom playground can also help simplify development for teams, since the whole team can use a custom playground without needing to manage individual cycle balances.

### Creating a custom playground instance

- #### Step 1: Clone the playground repo with the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-playground
```

- #### Step 2: To create a separate pool, first use the current playground [pool and `wasm-utils` canisters as the starting point](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-playground/tree/main/service).

- #### Step 3: Then, edit the `pool/Main.mo` file to change your custom playground settings.

Some settings you may want to change are:

- Add [access control](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-playground/blob/main/service/pool/Main.mo#L134) as desired, such as creating an `allowList` of principals that are permitted to use the custom playground.

- Configure the [canister's time to live](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-playground/blob/main/service/pool/Types.mo#L22).

- Change the [Wasm transformation to fit your desired configuration](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-playground/blob/main/service/pool/Main.mo#L150). In some cases, this may just be `wasm = args.wasm_module`, since if there is an `allowlist` in place, the principals allowed to install canisters can be trusted, such as:

```motoko no-repl
let wasm = args.wasm_module;
```

- #### Step 4: Then deploy the pool canister, and if necessary, deploy the `wasm-utils` canister:

```
dfx deploy pool
dfx deploy wasm-utils
```

- #### Step 5: Lastly, define the local playground network in your project's `dfx.json` file.

In this definition, you will need to set the playground canister's ID (the `pool` canister ID) and define the amount of seconds before a canister is returned to the pool, as shown below:

```json title="dfx.json"
"<network name>": {
  "playground": {
    "playground_canister": "<canister pool id>",
    "timeout_seconds": <amount of seconds after which a canister is returned to the pool>
  },
  "providers": [
      "https://icp0.io"
  ]
}
```

If the value `<network name>` is set as `playground`, then the command `dfx deploy --playground` will deploy to your custom playground. Otherwise, the command has to use `--network <network name>`.

:::info
This network definition can also go into the `networks.json` file, so it applies to every project, not just the current project since `dfx.json` files are project-specific. To see where the `networks.json` file is located, use the command `dfx info networks-json-path`.
:::

## Synthetic testnet

Another option to create a custom testnet is to use the `dfx` named network functionality. You can create a custom named network for each project, therefore creating a synthetic testnet that is segmented from the other locally tested projects in your environment. Local deployments mirror the mainnet as closely as possible, but local deployments only run a single subnet. Using a custom local network allows you to test integrations with services and estimate deployment costs.

In a custom network, it is possible to run any `dfx` command that would otherwise take `--network ic` but using `--network myNetwork` instead. `myNetwork` can be replaced with any other name, except the three reserved ones: `ic`, `local`, and `playground`.

Networks are defined in two ways: assumed and explicitly configured. `dfx` only contains the `ic` network as an assumed environment. All other networks are explicitly configured in the `networks.json` or `dfx.json` files. The "networks" section of `dfx.json` should contain at least the local network, which gets chosen by default if no other network is specified with the `--network` flag.

### System-wide networks

Custom networks can be configured in the `networks.json` configuration file for `dfx`, which can be found using the following `dfx` command:

```bash
dfx info networks-json-path
```

This will return the file path where your system's `networks.json` file is located. Networks defined in this file can be used by any project in your local environment.

- #### Step 1: To define a custom network, you can edit the `networks.json` file to define a binding address such as `localhost` or any other domain name.

For example:

```json title="networks.json"
{
  "myNetwork1": {
    "bind": "localhost:4943",
    "replica": {
      "subnet_type": "application"
    }
  }
}
```

To define multiple networks, use multiple definitions on different domain names:

```json title="networks.json"
{
  "myNetwork1": {
    "bind": "localhost:4943",
    "replica": {
      "subnet_type": "application"
    }
  },
  "myNetwork2": {
    "bind": "127.0.0.1:4943",
    "replica": {
      "subnet_type": "application"
    }
  }
}
```

- #### Step 2: Then, to deploy to one of these networks, use the `--network` flag with `dfx deploy`:

```bash
dfx deploy --network myNetwork2
```

### Project specific networks

Alternatively, networks can also be defined in a project's `dfx.json` file.

Only canisters defined in that `dfx.json` file can be deployed to that network.

To define a project-specific network, add a "networks" section to your `dfx.json` file, such as:

```json title="dfx.json"
"networks": {
    "myNetwork": {
      "providers": [
        "https://icp0.io"
      ],
      "type": "persistent"
    }
  }
```

This definition uses the following parameters:

- `providers`: The network provider; can be `localhost` or any other domain name. Domain names must be a full URL, such as `https://domain.com`.
- `type`: The type of network, either `ephemeral` or `persistent`. Ephemeral networks do not retain the same IDs for canisters, while persistent networks will retain the same canister IDs.

### Configuring a wallet

If you are using a cycles wallet, the cycles wallet for each network is stored separately.

:::caution
Please note that the cycles wallet will be removed from dfx in a future release.

It is recommended to use the cycles ledger instead.
:::

To use the same cycles wallet as on the main `ic` network, first make sure the correct identity is set by running the command:

```bash
dfx identity use <identity name>
```

Then, read the `ic` network's currently configured wallet using:

```bash
dfx identity get-wallet --network ic
```

Set the wallet for the newly defined network with the command:

```bash
dfx identity set-wallet <wallet id> --network myNetwork
```

These commands can be used together, such as:

```bash
dfx identity set-wallet "$(dfx identity get-wallet --network ic)" --network myNetwork
```

If you prefer to use a separate cycles wallet for the staging environment, follow the instructions in the step 'Creating a cycles wallet' in the [deploying to the mainnet guide](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy-and-manage).
