## Overview

To develop and deploy applications on the Internet Computer (ICP) from a local developer environment, two primary tools are used:

- **`dfx`**, a command-line tool used to create, deploy, and manage <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip>. `dfx` is developed and maintained by DFINITY. It supports the latest features of ICP.

- A **canister development kit** (CDK) which provides an environment for writing canister code in different programming languages while supporting ICP's features. CDKs exist for several languages, but only the CDKs for Motoko and Rust are developed and maintained by DFINITY. Other CDKs are community-developed.

These two tools are used in conjunction with one another. By default, `dfx` is packaged with the CDKs for Motoko and Rust canister development and has some limited support for TypeScript and Python development through the community-developed CDKs Azle and Kybra.

## What is `dfx`?

`dfx` is part of the [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk). The IC SDK is comprised of:

- `dfx`: A CLI tool.

- `dfxvm`: A version manager for `dfx`.

- `moc`: The [Motoko](/docs/current/motoko/main/getting-started/motoko-introduction) compiler to support Motoko canister development.

- `replica`: A local instance of the software run by each node on the ICP mainnet. It is used to deploy and host your application locally for testing and development.

It also has dependencies on a few additional, important packages:

- **Rust CDK**: A set of tools for developing Rust canisters.

- **Candid**: An interface description language (IDL) used to interact with a canister's methods. A **method** is a function exposed by the canister that can be called by a user, another canister, or the application's frontend.

When you install `dfx`, the entire IC SDK is installed. For advanced developers who may be interested in the binaries installed with `dfx`, you can view them at the path `$(dfx cache show)`.

## Installing `dfx`

`dfx` is natively supported on Linux or macOS 12.\* Monterey or later.

There is no native support for `dfx` on Windows. However, by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), you can run `dfx` on a Windows system as described below.

### dfxvm

To install `dfx`, the version manager tool [`dfxvm`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/dev-tools-overview#dfxvm) is used. You can download and install the latest version of dfxvm by running the command:

<AdornedTabs>
<TabItem value="apple" label="Install on macOS/Linux" default={true}>

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

If you are using a machine running Apple silicon (M1 or M2 CPU chips), you will need to have [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) installed, otherwise you will receive the error, `Bad CPU type in executable (os error 86)`.

You can install Rosetta by running the command:

```
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

<TabItem value="windows" label="Install on Windows">
There is no native support for <code>dfx</code> on Windows. However, there are a few different options for developers who are using a Windows machine:

- [Developer containers](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/dev-containers).

- Cloud-based environments, such as [GitHub Codespaces](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/codespaces) or [Gitpod](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/gitpod).

- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2).

#### Using WSL 2

:::caution
Not all features of `dfx` may be supported on WSL 2.
:::

Follow Microsoft&#39;s instructions for installing the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>. Make sure you are running Windows 10 (version 2004 or higher) or Windows 11.

It is recommended to use WSL 2 instead of WSL 1.

:::info
WSL 2 is supported on both Windows 10 and Windows 11, although Windows 11 is preferred as it has better support for WSL 2.
:::

#### Upgrade from WSL 1
If you have WSL 1 installed, follow the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2">upgrade instructions</a> to upgrade to WSL 2.

#### Running Linux
After you have WSL 2 installed, you can launch the Linux distributions by name.

For example, run the command:
<code>Ubuntu.exe</code> to start the <code>Ubuntu</code> distribution from the command line.

#### Installing `dfxvm`

Then, install <code>dfxvm</code> by running:

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

This will automatically install the latest version of <code>dfx</code> on your WSL 2 system.

For troubleshooting common WSL errors, please see [WSL troubleshooting](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/wsl-troubleshoot).

### Installing a specific `dfx` version

To install a specific version of `dfx`, use the command:

```
dfxvm install <version>
```

### Setting the default `dfx` version

To set the default `dfx` version that your local environment will use, use the command:

```
dfxvm default <version>
```

If the specified version is not installed, it will be installed, then set as the default.

To view which default version is currently configured, use the command:

```
dfxvm default
```

### Listing all `dfx` versions installed

To list all `dfx` versions that are installed, use the command:

```
dfxvm list
```


### Updating to the latest version

To update to the latest `dfx` version and set it as the default, use the command:

```
dfxvm update
```

## Setting environment variables

To customize your `dfx` installation, you can set environment variables for a session by exporting the variable in your terminal or adding a line to your `.profile` file.

To specify the installation location for the `dfx` binary, set the `DFX_INSTALLATION_ROOT` variable:

```
export DFX_INSTALLATION_ROOT=/path/to/install/dir
```

To specify a different location for the `dfx` subdirectories `.cache` and `.config`, set the `DFX_CONFIG_ROOT` such as:

```
export DFX_CONFIG_ROOT=/path/to/config/root
```

To set the version of `dfx` you want to install, set the `DFX_VERSION` variable:

```
export DFX_VERSION=0.21.0
```

## Starting `dfx`

Before you can start using `dfx` commands, you need to start `dfx`, which will run a local replica instance on your machine so you can create, deploy, and manage canisters.

To start `dfx`, use the command:

```
dfx start // Returns replica output in the terminal window. A new terminal window will need to be opened to continue running commands.
dfx start --background // Runs the processes in the background and allows you to continue running commands in the current terminal.
```

The `--clean` flag can also be used with `dfx start`, which removes checkpoints from your project cache. This flag can be helpful when troubleshooting or debugging.

## Stopping `dfx`

To stop `dfx`, simply use the `dfx stop` command.

If there are zombie `dfx` processes that are not stopped by `dfx stop`, you can use `dfx killall` to forcibly end them.

## Getting help

To view help information for `dfx`, you can use the `dfx help` command or view the [`dfx` reference documentation](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/).

## Next steps

Next, you must create a developer identity. This identity will be used to control and manage your project's canisters.
