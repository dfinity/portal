## Overview

The IC SDK is a software development kit used to develop and deploy applications on the Internet Computer (ICP) from a local developer environment. It includes several necessary tools for developing ICP applications.

## Installing the IC SDK

The IC SDK is natively supported on Linux or macOS 12.\* Monterey and newer. Windows users should install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2).

If you followed the [quick start](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/quickstart/first-smart-contract) guide, you can skip this step.

To customize your IC SDK installation, you can set [environment variables](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-envars) for a session by exporting the variable in your terminal or adding a line to your `.profile` file.

The [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk) is comprised of:

- `dfx`: A CLI tool used to create and manage projects, developer identities, and <GlossaryTooltip>cycles</GlossaryTooltip>.

- [`dfxvm`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/dev-tools-overview#dfxvm): A version manager for `dfx`. It is used to download a specific version of `dfx`, set a default version, and update to the latest version.

- `moc`: The [Motoko](/docs/current/motoko/main/getting-started/motoko-introduction) compiler to support Motoko canister development.

- `replica`: A local instance of the software run by each node on the ICP mainnet. It is used to deploy and host your application locally for testing and development.

It also has dependencies on a few additional, important packages:

- [**Rust CDK**](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/): A set of tools for developing Rust canisters.

- [**Candid**](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/candid/candid-concepts): An interface description language (IDL) used to interact with a canister's methods. A **method** is a function exposed by the canister that can be called by a user, another canister, or the application's frontend.


## Starting `dfx`

Before you can start using `dfx` commands, you need to start `dfx`, which will run a local replica instance on your machine so you can create, deploy, and manage canisters.

To start `dfx`, use the command:

- `dfx start`: Returns replica output in the terminal window. A new terminal window will need to be opened to continue running commands.

- `dfx start --background`: Runs the processes in the background and allows you to continue running commands in the current terminal.

## Stopping `dfx`

To stop `dfx`, simply use the `dfx stop` command.

If there are unresponsive `dfx` processes that are not stopped by `dfx stop`, you can use `dfx killall` to forcibly end them.

## Getting help

To view help information for `dfx`, you can use the `dfx help` command or view the [`dfx` reference documentation](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/).

## Next step

Next, you must create a developer identity. This identity will be used to control and manage your project's canisters.
