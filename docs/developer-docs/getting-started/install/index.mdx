# Installing tools

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Getting started", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

When developing on ICP, there are two primary tools used: `dfx`, a CLI tool used
to create, deploy, and manage <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip>, and
a **canister development kit** (CDK) which provides an environment for writing
canister code in different programming languages while supporting ICP features.

Currently supported CDKs include:

- [Motoko](/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko): ICP's native programming language.

- [Rust CDK](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs).

- [Kybra: Python CDK (Beta)](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/python).

- [Azle: TypeScript CDK (Beta)](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/typescript).

- [Bitfinity EVM for Solidity (Beta)](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/solidity).

- [C++ CDK](https://docs.icpp.world/).

## Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces

If you use GitHub Codespaces or
[Gitpod](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/gitpod) to deploy your
project, installing these dependencies is not necessary.

:::info Links to available Codespaces and Gitpod examples can be found in the
[hello world example](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/hello-world#create-a-new-project).
:::

## Installing `dfx`

`dfx` is part of the [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk).

`dfx` is natively supported on Linux or macOS 12.\* Monterey or later.

There is no native support for `dfx` on Windows. However, by installing the
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), you can run `dfx` on a Windows system as
described below.

:::caution Not all features of `dfx` may be supported on WSL 2. :::

You can download and install the latest version of the
[`dfx`](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk) by running the command below:

<AdornedTabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Install on Mac/Linux" default={true}>
    To install the IC SDK, run

    ```bash
    sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
    ```

    If you are using a machine running Apple silicon, you will need to have [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) installed. You can install Rosetta by running `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` in your terminal.

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Install on Windows">
    There is no native support for <code>dfx</code> on Windows. However, by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can run <code>dfx</code> also on a Windows system as described below.

    ## Installing WSL 2
    Follow Microsoft&#39;s instructions for installing the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>. Make sure you are running Windows 10 (version 2004 or higher) or Windows 11.

    ### Supported WSL Versions
    Theoretically, WSL 1 and WSL 2 should both allow you to run <code>dfx</code>. However, it is recommended to use WSL 2. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions">WSL Comparison</a> explains the differences between WSL1 and WSL 2.

    ### Check your WSL version
    Run the command <code>wsl –list –verbose (wsl -l -v)</code> to check the Linux distributions installed on your Windows machine. Below is an example output:

    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      NAME STATE VERSION
      * Ubuntu Running 2
    </CodeBlock>

    To learn more about the <code>wsl</code> command, check the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands">command reference for WSL</a>.

    ### Upgrade from WSL 1
    If you have WSL 1 installed, follow the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2">upgrade instructions</a> to upgrade to WSL 2. Basically you need to:

    <ul>
      <li>Step 1: Install the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package">WSL 2 Linux kernel update package</a>.</li>
      <li>Step 2: Run the following command to set your Linux distributions to version 2: <code>wsl--set-version &lt;distribution name&gt; 2</code></li>
    </ul>

    ## Running Linux
    After you have WSL installed, you can launch the Linux distributions by name.

    For example, run the command:
    <code>Ubuntu.exe</code> to start the <code>Ubuntu</code> distribution from the command line.

    ## Installing dfx

    Once you have WSL installed, you can install <code>dfx</code> by running:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
    </CodeBlock>

    ## Troubleshooting

    ### Node.js is not properly installed

    WSL 2 has node.js <code>10.x.x</code> installed by default. But the latest

    <code>dfx</code> requires node.js <code>16.x.x</code> or <code>18.x.x</code>.

    ### Permission denied when running <code>dfx start</code>

    Projects created from <code>dfx</code> need to be on the Linux filesystem
    instead of the Windows filesystem. Usually <code>cd ~</code> or <code>cd
    $HOME</code> in the WSL terminal will bring you to the home directory, and
    creating projects in there should work.

    ### No internet access on WSL

    If you don’t have internet access on WSL, for instance you cannot ping any
    server successfully, most likely the nameserver on WSL is set to an internal WSL
    proxy. You can check the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to see if it’s the
    case. If it’s true, please follow the below steps to set to a valid nameserver:

    <br />

    <ul>
      <li>
        Step 1: Create the <code>/etc/wsl.conf</code> file and add the below content
        to it, this will prevent WSL from regenerating the{" "}
        <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file after restarting.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <CodeBlock language="toml">
      [network]
      generateResolvConf = false
    </CodeBlock>

    <ul>
      <li>Step 2: Modify the nameserver in the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to a valid one, for example the Google nameserver <code>8.8.8.8</code>.</li>
      <li>Step 3: On Windows, restart WSL to let this fix take effect.</li>
      <code>wsl.exe --shutdown</code>
    </ul>

  </TabItem>
</AdornedTabs>

### Core components in a versioned directory

The `~/.cache/dfinity/versions` directory stores one or more versioned
subdirectories of `dfx`. Each versioned subdirectory contains the all of the
directories and files required for a specific version of `dfx`. For example, if
you list the contents of the `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/0.9.3` directory you
would see the following core components:

```

#### Motoko base directory

The `base` directory in the versioned subdirectory of `dfx` contains the Motoko
base library modules that are compatible with that version of `dfx`. Because the
Motoko base library is evolving rapidly, you should only use the base modules
that are packaged with the version of `dfx` that you have installed.

### Using the `dfx` version manager

Alteratively, to upgrade or install a specific version of `dfx` the dfx version
manager (`dfxvm`) can be used.

First, install `dfxvm` using the following `curl` command:

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/sdk/dfxvm-install-script/install.sh)"
```

Upon installation, you will be prompted to select which version of `dfx` you'd
like to install. You can also pass the intended version using an environment
variable, such as:

```
DFX_VERSION=0.15.1 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/sdk/dfxvm-install-script/install.sh)"
```

#### Installing a specific version

Once `dfxvm` is installed, you can install other specific versions of `dfx`
using the command:

```
dfxvm install [VERSION_NUMBER]
```

For example, you can install `0.15.0` with the command:

```
dfxvm install 0.15.0
```

#### Uninstalling a specific version

To uninstall a version of dfx using `dfxvm`, use the command:

```
dfxvm uninstall [VERSION_NUMBER]
```

For example, to uninstall version `0.14.4`, use the command:

```
dfxvm uninstall 0.14.4
```

#### Upgrading to the latest version

To update dfx to the latest version, use the command:

```
dfxvm update
```

#### Setting a default version

If defined, `dfx` will always run the version specified in the project's
`dfx.json` in the key `"dfx"`. For example, if your `dfx.json` contains
`"dfx": "0.11.1"`, any `dfx` command you run within this project's directory
will be executed by `dfx` of version `0.11.1`. Should the defined version not be
installed (e.g. because you cloned a repo that was created for a different
version than you have installed locally), `dfx` will report an error.

## Building from source

If you would like to compile `dfx` by yourself, head over to the
[IC SDK repo](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk). The README contains the
instructions on how you can build it on your own.

### Uninstalling `dfx`

When you install `dfx`, the installation script puts the required binary files
in a local directory and creates a cache. You can remove the `dfx` binaries and
cache from your local computer by running the `uninstall` script located in the
`.cache` folder.

For example:

```bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh
```

If you are uninstalling because you want to immediately reinstall a clean
version of `dfx`, you can run the following command:

```bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

## Installing a CDK

### Motoko

By default, Motoko is installed with `dfx`. Alternatively, you can build it from
source following
[these instructions](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/blob/master/Building.md).

### Rust

By default, the Rust CDK is installed with `dfx`. Alternatively, you can install
it yourself by adding the following dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
ic-cdk = "0.12"
# Only necessary if you want to define Candid data types
candid = "0.10"
```

Below is a brief example on how to use the Rust CDK:

```rust
#[ic_cdk::query]
fn hello() -> String {
    "world".to_string()
}
```

### TypeScript / JavaScript

The TypeScript and JavaScript CDK, known as Azle, can be installed with `dfx` in
versions `v0.16.1` and newer. To install it manually, you can follow
[these steps](https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/tree/main/examples/hello_world).

:::caution Azle is currently in beta and should be used with caution. :::

### Python

The Python CDK, known as Kybra, can be installed by following these steps:

- #### Step 1: Install `pyenv`

```
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

- #### Step 2: Install Python 3.10.7:

```
~/.pyenv/bin/pyenv install 3.10.7
```

- #### Step 3: Install `dfx` v0.14.2:

```
DFX_VERSION=0.14.2 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
```

- #### Step 4: Add `$HOME/bin` to your path:

```
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"' >> "$HOME/.bashrc"
```

:::caution Kybra is currently in beta and should be used with caution. :::

### Solidity

Solidity smart contracts can be created using the Bitfinity EVM. To use the
Bitfinity EVM, you can make calls to the
[Bitfinity mainnet or testnet.](https://docs.bitfinity.network/getting-started/network-endpoints).

[Learn more about how to use the Bitfinity EVM](https://docs.bitfinity.network/ic-agent/overview)

:::caution Bitfinity EVM is currently in beta and should be used with caution.
:::

### C++

C++ is supported through the ICPP-pro CDK, which can be installed with the
following steps:

- #### Step 1: Install `icpp-pro` with `pip`:

```
pip install icpp-pro
```

- #### Step 2: Install `wasi-sdk`:

```
icpp install-wasi-sdk
```

- #### Step 3: Install the latest version of `dfx`:

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```
