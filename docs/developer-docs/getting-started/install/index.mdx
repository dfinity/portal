# Installing tools

## Overview

When developing on ICP, there are two primary tools used: `dfx`, a CLI tool used to create, deploy, and manage canisters, and a **canister development kit** (CDK) which provides an environment for writing canister code in different programming languages while supporting ICP features. 

Currently supported CDKs include:

- [Motoko](/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko): ICP's native programming language.

- [Rust CDK](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs).

- [Kybra: Python CDK (Beta)](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/python).

- [Azle: TypeScript CDK (Beta)](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/typescript). 

- [Bitfinity EVM for Solidity (Beta)](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/solidity).

- [C++ CDK](https://docs.icpp.world/).


## Installing `dfx`

`dfx` is part of the [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk).

`dfx` is natively supported on Linux or macOS 12.\* Monterey or later. 

There is no native support for `dfx` on Windows. However, by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), you can run `dfx` on a Windows system as described below.

:::caution
Not all features of `dfx` may be supported on WSL 2.
:::

You can download and install the latest version of the [`dfx`](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk) by running the command below:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Install on Mac/Linux" default>
    To install the IC SDK, run

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

:::tip
If you are using a machine running Apple silicon, you will need to have
[Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) installed. You can install Rosetta by running
`softwareupdate --install-rosetta` in your terminal.

      running Windows 10 (version 2004 or higher) or Windows 11.</p>
    <h3 id="supported-wsl-versions">Supported WSL Versions</h3>
    <p>Theoretically, WSL 1 and WSL 2 should both allow you to run <code>dfx</code>. However, it is recommended to use WSL 2. <a

    </ul>
    <h2 id="running-linux">Running Linux</h2>
    <p>After you have WSL installed, you can launch the Linux distributions by name.</p>

    <h3 id="node-js-is-not-properly-installed">Node.js is not properly installed</h3>
    <p>WSL 2 has node.js <code>10.x.x</code> installed by default. But the latest <code>dfx</code> requires
      node.js <code>16.0.0</code> or higher.</p>
    <h3 id="permission-denied-when-running-dfx-start-">Permission denied when running <code>dfx start</code></h3>
    <p>Projects created from <code>dfx</code> need to be on the Linux filesystem instead of the Windows filesystem.
      Usually <code>cd ~</code> or <code>cd $HOME</code> in the WSL terminal will bring you to the home directory, and
      creating projects in there should work.</p>
    <h3 id="no-internet-access-on-wsl">No internet access on WSL</h3>
    <p>If you don’t have internet access on WSL, for instance you cannot ping any server successfully, most likely the
      nameserver on WSL is set to an internal WSL proxy. You can check the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to see if
      it’s the case. If it’s true, please follow the below steps to set to a valid nameserver: <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Create the <code>/etc/wsl.conf</code> file and add the below content to it, this will prevent WSL from
          regenerating the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file after restarting.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
      <CodeBlock language="toml">
{`[network]
generateResolvConf = false`}
      </CodeBlock>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 2: Modify the nameserver in the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to a valid one, for example the Google
          nameserver <code>8.8.8.8</code>. </li>
        <li>Step 3: On Windows, restart WSL to let this fix take effect.</li>
        <code>wsl.exe --shutdown</code>

### Core components in a versioned directory

The `~/.cache/dfinity/versions` directory stores one or more versioned subdirectories of `dfx`. Each versioned subdirectory contains the all of the directories and files required for a specific version of `dfx`. For example, if you list the contents of the `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/0.9.3` directory you would see the following core components:

#### Motoko base directory

The `base` directory in the versioned subdirectory of `dfx` contains the Motoko base library modules that are compatible with that version of `dfx`. Because the Motoko base library is evolving rapidly, you should only use the base modules that are packaged with the version of `dfx` that you have installed.

### Using the `dfx` version manager

Alteratively, to upgrade or install a specific version of `dfx` the dfx version manager (`dfxvm`) can be used. 

First, install `dfxvm` using the following `curl` command:

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/sdk/dfxvm-install-script/install.sh)"
```

Upon installation, you will be prompted to select which version of `dfx` you'd like to install. You can also pass the intended version using an environment variable, such as:

```
DFX_VERSION=0.15.1 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/sdk/dfxvm-install-script/install.sh)"
```

#### Installing a specific version

Once `dfxvm` is installed, you can install other specific versions of `dfx` using the command:

```
dfxvm install [VERSION_NUMBER]
```

For example, you can install `0.15.0` with the command:

```
dfxvm install 0.15.0
```

#### Uninstalling a specific version

To uninstall a version of dfx using `dfxvm`, use the command:

```
dfxvm uninstall [VERSION_NUMBER]
```

For example, to uninstall version `0.14.4`, use the command:

```
dfxvm uninstall 0.14.4
```

#### Upgrading to the latest version

To update dfx to the latest version, use the command:

```
dfxvm update
```

#### Setting a default version

If defined, `dfx` will always run the version specified in the project's `dfx.json` in the key `"dfx"`.
For example, if your `dfx.json` contains `"dfx": "0.11.1"`, any `dfx` command you run within this project's directory will be executed by `dfx` of version `0.11.1`.
Should the defined version not be installed (e.g. because you cloned a repo that was created for a different version than you have installed locally), `dfx` will report an error.

:::info
You can learn more about `dfxvm` [here](https://github.com/dfinity/dfxvm/tree/main).
:::

## Building from source

If you would like to compile `dfx` by yourself, head over to the [IC SDK repo](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk). The README contains the instructions how you can build it on your own.

### Uninstalling `dfx`

When you install `dfx`, the installation script puts the required binary files in a local directory and creates a cache. You can remove the `dfx` binaries and cache from your local computer by running the `uninstall` script located in the `.cache` folder.

For example:

``` bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh
```

If you are uninstalling because you want to immediately reinstall a clean version of `dfx`, you can run the following command:

``` bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

## Installing a CDK

### Motoko

By default, Motoko is installed with `dfx`. Alternatively, you can build it from source following [these instructions](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/blob/master/Building.md). 

### Rust

By default, the Rust CDK is installed with `dfx`. Alternatively, you can install it yourself by adding the following dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```rust
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
ic-cdk = "0.12"
# Only necessary if you want to define Candid data types
candid = "0.10" 
```

Below is a brief example on how to use the Rust CDK:

```rust
#[ic_cdk::query]
fn hello() -> String {
    "world".to_string()
}
```


### TypeScript / JavaScript 

The TypeScript and JavaScript CDK, known as Azle, can be installed with `dfx` in versions `v0.16.1` and newer. To install it manually, you can follow [these steps](https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/tree/main/examples/hello_world). 

:::caution
Azle is currently in beta and should be used with caution.
:::


### Python

The Python CDK, known as Kybra, can be installed by following these steps:

- #### Step 1: Install `pyenv`

```
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

- #### Step 2: Install Python 3.10.7:

```
~/.pyenv/bin/pyenv install 3.10.7
```

- #### Step 3: Install `dfx` v0.14.2:

```
DFX_VERSION=0.14.2 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
```

- #### Step 4: Add `$HOME/bin` to your path:

```
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"' >> "$HOME/.bashrc"
```

:::caution
Kybra is currently in beta and should be used with caution.
:::

### Solidity

Solidity smart contracts can be created using the Bitfinity EVM. To use the Bitfinity EVM, you can make calls to the [Bitfinity mainnet or testnet.](https://docs.bitfinity.network/getting-started/network-endpoints).

[Learn more about how to use the Bitfinity EVM](https://docs.bitfinity.network/ic-agent/overview)

:::caution
Bitfinity EVM is currently in beta and should be used with caution.
:::

### C++ 

C++ is supported through the ICPP-pro CDK, which can be installed with the following steps:

- #### Step 1: Install `icpp-pro` with `pip`:

```
pip install icpp-pro
```

- #### Step 2: Install `wasi-sdk`:

```
icpp install-wasi-sdk
```

- #### Step 3: Install the latest version of `dfx`:

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```
