# Installing tools

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Getting started", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

When developing on ICP, there are two primary tools used: `dfx`, a CLI tool used
to create, deploy, and manage <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip>, and
a **canister development kit** (CDK) which provides an environment for writing
canister code in different programming languages while supporting ICP features.

Currently supported CDKs include:

- [Motoko](/docs/current/motoko/main/getting-started/motoko-introduction): ICP's native programming language.

- [Rust CDK](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs).

- [Kybra: Python CDK (Beta)](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/python/).

- [Azle: TypeScript CDK (Beta)](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/typescript/).

- [Bitfinity EVM for Solidity (Beta)](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/solidity/).

- [C++ CDK](https://docs.icpp.world/).

## Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces

If you use GitHub Codespaces or
[Gitpod](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/gitpod) to deploy your
project, installing these dependencies is not necessary.

:::info
Links to available Codespaces and Gitpod examples can be found in the
[hello world example](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/hello-world#create-a-new-project).

## Installing `dfx` via `dfxvm`

`dfx` is part of the [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk).

`dfx` is natively supported on Linux or macOS 12.\* Monterey or later.

There is no native support for `dfx` on Windows. However, by installing the
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), you can run `dfx` on a Windows system as
described below.

:::caution
Not all features of `dfx` may be supported on WSL 2.
:::

To install the IC SDK, install `dfxvm`. `dfxvm` is a command-line tool used for installing and switching between different versions of `dfx`.

It enables developers to pivot between different projects that are built with different `dfx` versions. [Read more about `dfxvm`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/dev-tools-overview#dfxvm).

You can download and install the latest version of [`dfxvm`](https://github.com/dfinity/dfxvm) by running the command below:

<AdornedTabs>
<TabItem value="apple" label="Install on Mac/Linux" default={true}>

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

If you are using a machine running Apple silicon, you will need to have [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) installed. You can install Rosetta by running `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` in your terminal.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Install on Windows">
There is no native support for <code>dfx</code> on Windows. However, you can develop ICP canisters on Windows using a Docker container or by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Using Docker

Docker is a containerization software that allows you to run a localized version of another operating system, such as Linux, then run Linux-based software and applications. Containers do not have access to the files and applications outside of the container unless given explicit permission.

To use Docker, first [install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Open the Docker Desktop application to start the Docker Daemon. Then, open a command line window and pull the DFINITY ICP developer environment Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dfinity/icp-dev-env:latest
```

Then, run an instance of this Docker image with the command:

```bash
docker run --platform linux/x86_64 -dit ghcr.io/dfinity/icp-dev-env:latest
```

Confirm that your container is running by using the `docker ps` command:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
b197b1da16df   ghcr.io/dfinity/icp-dev-env:latest   "bash"    37 seconds ago   Up 36 seconds             peaceful_lumiere
```

Now you can navigate into your Docker container and begin running commands such as `dfx`. To navigate into the canister, run the command:

```bash
docker exec -it <NAME> bash
```

Replace `<NAME>` with the canister name shown in the `docker ps` output.

If successful, your command line prompt will change such as:

```bash
root@b197b1da16df:/#
```

Verify that `dfx` has been installed and is ready to use by running the command:

```bash
dfx --version
```

This should return the version of `dfx` that was installed:

```bash
dfx 0.18.0
```

## Using WSL 2
Follow Microsoft&#39;s instructions for installing the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>. Make sure you are running Windows 10 (version 2004 or higher) or Windows 11.

### Supported WSL Versions
Theoretically, WSL 1 and WSL 2 should both allow you to run <code>dfx</code>. However, it is recommended to use WSL 2. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions">WSL Comparison</a> explains the differences between WSL1 and WSL 2.

### Check your WSL version
Run the command <code>wsl –list –verbose (wsl -l -v)</code> to check the Linux distributions installed on your Windows machine. Below is an example output:

```bash
  NAME STATE VERSION
  * Ubuntu Running 2
```

To learn more about the <code>wsl</code> command, check the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands">command reference for WSL</a>.

### Upgrade from WSL 1
If you have WSL 1 installed, follow the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2">upgrade instructions</a> to upgrade to WSL 2. Basically you need to:

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Install the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package">WSL 2 Linux kernel update package</a>.</li>
  <li>Step 2: Run the following command to set your Linux distributions to version 2: <code>wsl--set-version &lt;distribution name&gt; 2</code></li>
</ul>

## Running Linux
After you have WSL installed, you can launch the Linux distributions by name.

For example, run the command:
<code>Ubuntu.exe</code> to start the <code>Ubuntu</code> distribution from the command line.

## Installing `dfx` via `dfxvm`

Once you have WSL installed, you can install <code>dfxvm</code> by running:
```bash
  sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```
This will automatically install the latest version of <code>dfx</code> on your WSL.

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js is not properly installed

WSL 2 has node.js <code>10.x.x</code> installed by default. But the latest

<code>dfx</code> requires node.js <code>16.x.x</code> or <code>18.x.x</code>.

### Permission denied when running <code>dfx start</code>

Projects created from <code>dfx</code> need to be on the Linux filesystem
instead of the Windows filesystem. Usually <code>cd ~</code> or <code>cd $HOME</code>
in the WSL terminal will bring you to the home directory, and creating projects in t
here should work.

### No internet access on WSL

If you don’t have internet access on WSL, for instance you cannot ping any
server successfully, most likely the nameserver on WSL is set to an internal WSL
proxy. You can check the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to see if it’s the
case. If it’s true, please follow the below steps to set to a valid nameserver:

<br />

<ul>
  <li>
    Step 1: Create the <code>/etc/wsl.conf</code> file and add the below content
    to it, this will prevent WSL from regenerating the{" "}
    <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file after restarting.
  </li>
</ul>

```bash
  [network]
  generateResolvConf = false
```

<ul>
  <li>Step 2: Modify the nameserver in the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to a valid one, for example the Google nameserver <code>8.8.8.8</code>.</li>
  <li>Step 3: On Windows, restart WSL to let this fix take effect.</li>
  <code>wsl.exe --shutdown</code>
</ul>

## Installing a CDK

### Motoko

By default, Motoko is installed with `dfx`. Alternatively, you can build it from
source following
[these instructions](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/blob/master/Building.md).

### Rust

By default, the Rust CDK is installed with `dfx`. Alternatively, you can install
it yourself by adding the following dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
ic-cdk = "0.12"
# Only necessary if you want to define Candid data types
candid = "0.10"
```

Below is a brief example on how to use the Rust CDK:

```rust
#[ic_cdk::query]
fn hello() -> String {
    "world".to_string()
}
```

### TypeScript / JavaScript

By default, the TypeScript and JavaScript CDK, known as Azle, is installed with `dfx`.
