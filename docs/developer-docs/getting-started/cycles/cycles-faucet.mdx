# Getting started with free cycles

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

To deploy a <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip> onto the ICP mainnet, you must have cycles. Cycles are used to pay for the resources that a canister uses.

This guide explains how to use the **cycles faucet** to acquire 10T free cycles that can be used to deploy your dapps on the mainnet.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Install the [Internet Computer SDK](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install/).

## Step 1: Get a coupon.

First, you will need to navigate to [https://faucet.dfinity.org](https://faucet.dfinity.org). You will need to put in a request for cycles on the [DFINITY dev official Discord](https://discord.gg/jnjVVQaE2C) server. You can click on the **REQUEST CYCLES** button on the faucet page to join the Discord server.

## Step 2: Once inside the Discord server, navigate into the `#cycles-faucet` channel.

## Step 3: In this channel, execute the following slash command:

```
/request
```

## Step 4: After you send this message, you are prompted to fill out a survey.

## Step 5: Once completed, our team will review your submission. If accepted, the faucet bot will send you a private message with a coupon code.

:::caution
Please ensure that your Discord settings are set to allow direct messages from other users. If you do not have this setting enabled, you will not receive a direct message from the faucet bot.

## Step 6: Head back to the [https://faucet.dfinity.org](https://faucet.dfinity.org) webpage.

Now, click **NEXT STEP** to continue.

## Step 7: Redeem the coupon.

Now that you have a coupon code, enter your coupon code within the faucet UI.

Click **NEXT STEP** to continue.

## Step 8: Setup the IC SDK.

Next, confirm your computer has `dfx` installed. Run this command to check the version of `dfx` on your computer:

```
dfx --version
```

If your `dfx` version is below 0.12.0, please run this command:

```
dfx upgrade
```

Click **NEXT STEP** to continue.

## Step 9: Create a new identity to claim your cycles.

To create a new identity, use the command:

```
dfx identity new MyNewIdentity
```

Your identity's seed phrase will be returned. Be sure to save this in a secure location.

Then, set this identity to be used by default:

```
dfx identity use MyNewIdentity
```

## Step 10: Now, claim your cycles.

This workflow utilizes the **cycles ledger** feature. If you'd like to use the **cycles wallet** instead, [view the cycles wallet documentation](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/cycles/cycles-wallet).

To use the cycles ledger, you will need [`dfx` version 0.19.0](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install/), and you will need to set the following environmental variable:

```
DFX_CYCLES_LEDGER_SUPPORT_ENABLE=1
```

You will need to claim your free cycles by running this command:

```
dfx cycles --network ic redeem-faucet-coupon <your-coupon-code>
```

Click **NEXT STEP** to continue.

## Step 11: Verify your balance

The last step is to verify the coupon was redeemed correctly by checking your balance using the `dfx cycles --network ic balance` command:

## Conclusion

Now you are ready to deploy a canister on the mainnet!
