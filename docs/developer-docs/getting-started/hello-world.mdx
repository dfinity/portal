# Hello, world!

This guide shows how to get started developing on ICP quickly by deploying your first 'Hello, world!' smart contract. 

## Install dependencies

### Install the IC SDK (v0.15.2 and newer)

Download and install the latest version of [dfx](install/index.mdx). dfx is a CLI tool used for developing and deploying ICP smart contracts:

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

### Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
nvm install 18
```

## Start the local replica

```bash
dfx start
```

This command starts a local instance of the ICP replica using a single node testnet. The output will return a dashboard URL that can be used to view information about the local replica:

```
Running dfx start for version 0.15.2
Initialized replica.
Dashboard: http://localhost:35375/_/dashboard
```

:::info
While `dfx start` is running, you will not be able to run other commands in the terminal window. You can open another window, or start dfx in the background with the `dfx start --background` flag.

## Create a new project

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

```bash
dfx new hello
cd hello
npm install
```

For projects created with `dfx new` (Motoko and Rust) the command automatically generates the project's default configuration and two default smart contracts. 

The `npm install` command is used to install libraries and dependencies.

For information about project structure and default configuration, [learn more about the default project structure and configuration](default-template.mdx).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```bash
dfx new hello --type=rust
cd hello
npm install
```

For projects created with `dfx new` (Motoko and Rust) the command automatically generates the project's default configuration and two default smart contracts. 

The `npm install` command is used to install libraries and dependencies.

In order to build Rust projects for ICP you need to add the following target to your Rust toolchain:

``` bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Smart contract code


<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

Motoko is an Actor-based language and it represents the smart contract as an actor with various methods that the users and other smart contract can call.

This hello-world actor has a single function called greet. It is marked as query because it doesn't modify the state of the actor.  The function accepts a name as input and returns a greetings text.

```motoko
// src/hello_backend/main.mo
actor {
public query func greet(name : Text) : async Text {
    return "Hello, " # name # "!";
};
};
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

This Rust smart contract has a single function called greet. It is marked as query because it doesn't modify the state of the canister.
The function accepts a name as input and returns a greetings text.

```rust
// src/hello_world_backend/src/lib.rs
#[ic_cdk::query]
fn greet(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
// azle_hello/src/index.ts
import { Canister, query, text, update, Void } from 'azle';

// This is a global variable that is stored on the heap.
let message = '';

export default Canister({
    // Query calls complete quickly because they do not go through consensus.
    getMessage: query([], text, () => {
        return message;
    }),
    // Update calls take a few seconds to complete.
    // This is because they persist state changes and go through consensus.
    setMessage: update([text], Void, (newMessage) => {
        message = newMessage; // This change will be persisted
    })
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

Create the project directory and file structure:

```python
# kybra_hello/src/main.py

from kybra import query, update, void

# This is a global variable that is stored on the heap.
message: str = ''

# Query calls complete quickly because they do not go through consensus.
@query
def get_message() -> str:
    return message

# Update calls take a few seconds to complete.
# This is because they persist state changes and go through consensus.
@update
def set_message(new_message: str) -> void:
    global message
    message = new_message # This change will be persisted
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Deploy locally 

Deploy the project's canisters locally:

```
dfx deploy
```

This command performs several functions in the background:

- It sets up a special `cycle-wallet` smart contract for storing cycles. All operations require payments in cycles. In your local testnet, this wallet comes prefilled with cycles.

- It builds the smart contracts defined in the `dfx.json` file into Wasm binaries.

- It creates smart contracts on the local testnet and saves their addresses in the file `./.dfx/local/canister_ids.json`.

- It installs the Wasm binaries onto the new smart contracts.

## Call the smart contracts from the CLI

<Tabs groupId="language">

<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

```bash
dfx canister call hello_backend greet world
```

Output:

```
("Hello, world!")
```

This command performs several functions in the background: 

- First, it looks up the smart contract's address (known as the canister id) using the smart contract's name `hello_backend` in the file `./.dfx/local/canister_ids.json`.

- Then, it looks up the smart contract's interface in the file `src/declarations/hello_backend/hello_backend.did`. 

- It looks up the signature of function greet in the interface.

- It constructs a message for the smart contract's `greet` endpoint with the given `name` text as an argument.

- It signs the message with the private key of the [developer account](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/accounts).

- It sends the message to the local testnet (replica). 

- Once the message has been executed, the result was decoded using the interface file and printed to the terminal window.

<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```bash
dfx canister call azle_hello setMessage '("Hello, world!")'
```

This command sends an update call to the smart contract's `setMessage` function to store the value 'Hello, world!' in the smart contract's memory. 

Then, call the `getMessage` function:

```
dfx canister call azle_hello getMessage
```

This command sends a query call to the smart contract's `getMessage` function to return the value stored by the `setMessage` function. 

Output:

```
("Hello, world!")
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```bash
dfx canister call kybra_hello set_message '("Hello, world!")'
```

This command sends an update call to the smart contract's `setMessage` function to store the value 'Hello, world!' in the smart contract's memory. 

Then, call the `getMessage` function:

```
dfx canister call kybra_hello getMessage
```

This command sends a query call to the smart contract's `getMessage` function to return the value stored by the `setMessage` function. 

Output:

```
("Hello, world!")
```

Alternatively, you can interact with the smart contract via the web browser if a frontend smart contract has been deployed. [Learn more about using the frontend smart contract in the web browser](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/local)
