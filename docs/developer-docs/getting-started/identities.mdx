# Creating a developer identity

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Getting started", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

On the Internet Computer (ICP), a developer **identity** is essential to developing canisters. Developer identities use a private/public key pair for authentication. Private/public key pairs are a set of cryptographically generated keys. The public key can be distributed openly, as it will be used by services to encrypt messages. Only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt these messages, therefore the private key must be kept secret and stored securely.

Developer identities are identified by a **principal**, which is a generic identifier value that is used to identify users, <GlossaryTooltip>canisters</GlossaryTooltip>, and potentially other entities on the network in the future. Each developer identity's principal value is derived from the identity's public key from the private/public key pair.

## What are developer identities used for?

When a canister is created and deployed, the developer identity that created the canister is automatically set as a **controller** of that canister. A controller has permission to manage the canister, including:

- Starting and stopping the canister.

- Installing canister code.

- Upgrading the canister.

- Viewing the canister's status.

- Viewing the canister's logs.

- Configuring the settings of the canister, such as setting the resource allocation or adding additional controllers.

If you are working on a project collaboratively with others, your identity's principal can be added as a controller of that project's canisters so you have permission to manage those canisters.

Once a canister is deployed, it will consume resources such as storage and compute. Canisters must pay for these resources using **cycles**. Your developer identity is used to mint and transfer cycles through the **cycles ledger**.

### ICP identity terms

Developer identities are not the only form of identity on ICP. Other ICP identity-related terms you may come across include:

- **Ledger account identifier**: The identifier associated with your ICP ledger account.

- **Wallets**: Used to store forms of currency.

- **Internet Identity**: ICP's native authentication service. Internet Identity doesn't use usernames and passwords; instead, it uses a passkey that is stored in your local device's hardware.

## Creating your developer identity

By default, `dfx` will use the `default` identity. ***This identity is not stored securely and should not be used for creating or deploying canisters.***

It is highly recommended that you create a new identity with the command:

```
dfx identity new IDENTITY_NAME
```

:::note
Identities created with `dfx` are global; they are not confined to a specific project's context.

Identity names must use the characters `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.-_@0123456789`.
:::

### Storing the identity's private key

The private key for an identity is stored in the `~/.config/dfx/identity/IDENTITY_NAME/identity.pem` file. ***This file should be backed up to a secure location.***

## Using your identity

Once your identity is created, you must tell `dfx` that this is the identity you want to use. If you do not, the `default` identity will be used and any canister creation and management you execute will not be secure.

To use your new identity, run the command:

```
dfx identity use IDENTITY_NAME
```

### Getting your identity's principal

To obtain the principal identifier for your identity, use the command:

```
dfx identity get-principal
```

## Next step

Next, you must obtain cycles. Cycles are required to pay for the resources a canister consumes.
