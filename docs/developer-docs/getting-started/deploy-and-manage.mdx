## Overview

Once a canister's code has been written, it must be compiled into Wasm, installed into the canister itself, and then deployed to a network. The `dfx deploy` command executes each of these tasks as part of the deployment process; however, `dfx` commands also exist for running each step individually.

It is recommended to deploy canisters locally or to the temporary [playground](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/deploy/overview#deploying-to-playground) network to test canister functionality and make adjustments before considering the canister production-ready and deploying it to the mainnet. Deploying canisters locally and to the playground is free and does not cost cycles. Once a canister is deployed to the mainnet, it will consistently consume cycles and will need to be topped up periodically.

## Start the local replica

To deploy your canister locally, first start the local replica. This simulates the mainnet environment with a single node for local development and testing.

- `dfx start`: Returns replica output in the terminal window. A new terminal window will need to be opened to continue running commands.

- `dfx start --background`: Runs the processes in the background and allows you to continue running commands in the current terminal.


## Deploy locally 

Deploy the backend canister that you have written code for:

```
dfx deploy PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=local
```

:::info
The `--network=local` flag here is redundant and shown for educational purposes. The local network is the default setting for `dfx` commands; therefore, no flag is needed to target it.
:::

This will deploy your project to the local replica. In the background, this command:

- Creates the canister(s) specified in the command; if no canister name was specified, it will deploy all canisters listed in the `dfx.json` file.

- Compiles the code for each canister into a Wasm module.

- Installs the Wasm module into each canister.

- Deploys the canister(s) to the deployment endpoint of choice (local, playground, mainnet).

```

</details>

Your deployed canister will now be executing two timers and printing the output directly to the terminal window:

```

```

You can interact with the canister's public methods either in your web browser through the [Candid UI](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/candid/candid-concepts) URL that was returned in the deployment output or using the command line. Candid is an interface description language used to interact with a canister's public methods.

## Upgrades

Canisters can be upgraded, allowing the same canister ID to be retained for an application. Upgrades preserve the state of a canister while allowing you to change the code. However, canister upgrades clear the canister's Wasm memory. Any data not stored in [stable memory](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/storage) will be removed.

In your backend canister source code file, make a change such as increasing the timer to 60 seconds rather than 30 seconds. Save the file.

Next, you must compile the updated canister code into a new Wasm module. `dfx build` is used for compilation:

```
dfx build PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=local
```

Then, upgrade your canister to use the new Wasm module:

```
dfx canister install PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=local --mode upgrade
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```

```

</details>

Confirm that the change you made results in the expected functionality or behavior. Then, stop the canister:

```
dfx canister stop PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=local
```

## Deploy to the mainnet

Now that the canister has been tested, you can deploy it to the mainnet. **Deploying to the mainnet costs [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/tokens-and-cycles).**

Confirm that you are using the correct developer identity and that you have an available cycles balance:

```
dfx identity whoami
dfx cycles balance --network=ic
```

Then, deploy to the mainnet:

```
dfx deploy PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=ic
```

The canister's Candid UI URL that is now hosted on the mainnet will be returned:

```

    PROJECT_NAME_backend: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=y4oop-liaaa-aaaab-qacha-cai
```

:::caution
When a canister is running on the mainnet, you will always need to pass the `--network=ic` flag to interact with it.
:::

## Settings

After a canister is deployed to the mainnet, it will constantly be consuming resources and cycles. To view information about how many resources and cycles currently being used, along with other information, view the canister's settings:

```
dfx canister status PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=ic

- **Status:** Indicates if the canister is currently running, stopped, or stopping.

- **Controllers:** Developer identities that have permission to manage the canister.

- **Memory allocation:** The amount of memory resources requested by the canister.

- **Compute allocation:** The amount of compute resources requested by the canister.

- **Balance**: The current cycles balance of the canister. By default, this is 3T cycles. This default balance can be changed by passing the `--with-cycles` flag to the `dfx canister create` command. This amount must be more than 100B, as the 100B cycles creation fee will be deducted from the amount you specify in `--with-cycles`.

- **Freezing threshold**: A length of time specified in seconds. It reflects the amount of time estimated until the canister runs out of cycles based on the number of idle cycles burned by the canister.

- **Idle cycles burned per day**: A calculation of how many cycles the canister burns per day without considering ingress or egress messages. The number of idle cycles is estimated based on the canister's size and the current cost of storage on the network.

- **Reserved**: A separate cycles balance set aside for resource payments.

- **Reserved cycles limit**: The maximum amount of cycles that can be set as 'reserved'.

- **Wasm memory limit:** The maximum size for a canister's Wasm memory. [Learn more about resource limits](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/resource-limits).

## Topping up

A canister will burn cycles even in an idle state to pay for the network storage it uses. Additional costs will be charged whenever the canister sends and receives messages, uses compute resources, or uses special features like HTTPS outcalls and threshold signatures.

Even static canisters will eventually need to have their cycles balance replenished; otherwise, the canister will be deleted. This is known as "topping up" the canister.

:::tip
Anyone can top up a canister. You do not need to be a controller of the canister to send it cycles.
:::

To top up a canister, replace AMOUNT with the number of cycles to top up the canister with (i.e., `3T` to send 3 trillion cycles):

```
dfx cycles top-up PROJECT_NAME_backend AMOUNT --network ic
```

To check that your top up was successful, check the balance of the canister with `dfx canister status PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=ic`.

### Cycles management tools

Manually monitoring canisters to determine when they are getting close to the freezing threshold can be time-consuming and complicated if you have a project with many canisters. Several community tools exist to make monitoring canisters easy. Some of them allow you to set automation rules to automatically top up canisters if their cycles balance dips below a certain amount, while others provide a one-time top up workflow. Some of these tools include:

- [CycleOps](https://cycleops.dev/app/personal): A comprehensive canister monitoring tool that provides top up automation, a statistics dashboard, email alerts, and the ability to create teams for synchronized management of collaborative projects.

- [ICPTopup.com](https://www.icptopup.com/): A simplified version of CycleOps that allows you to top up several canisters (up to 50) at one time.

### Freezing threshold

To prevent a canister from running out of cycles and being deleted, you can set what is known as a **freezing threshold**. This threshold is a duration of time set in seconds, indicating the minimum duration that the canister should exist without running out of cycles. Once a canister hits this threshold, it will not execute messages. It will only pay for the network resources it uses, such as compute allocation, memory usage, and storage allocation.

The default value of the freezing threshold is 2_592_000 (approximately 30 days). To change the freezing threshold, update the canister's settings with the command:

```
dfx canister update-settings PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=ic --freezing-threshold SECONDS
```

:::caution
If you set a freezing threshold longer than 1.5 years, you will need to include an additional flag: `--confirm-very-long-freezing-threshold`.
:::


## Logging

[Canister logs](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/logs) can be used to gain insight into a canister's behavior and assist with debugging situations such as when a canister traps.

View your canister's logs:

```
dfx canister logs PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=ic
```

By default, canister logs are only visible to the canister's controllers, but they can be made public by updating the canister's settings:

```
dfx canister update-settings PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=ic --log-visibility public
```

## Snapshots

Canister snapshots are used as a checkpoint that can be used to roll back your canister to a previous version in the event that the latest upgraded version becomes unresponsive or stops working as expected.

To create a canister snapshot, first stop your canister:

```
dfx canister stop PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=ic
```

Then, take a snapshot of the canister's current Wasm code and data.

```
dfx canister snapshot create PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=ic
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```

```

</details>

:::caution

Currently, only one snapshot per canister can be saved. Taking another snapshot will overwrite the existing snapshot.

```
dfx canister snapshot list PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=ic

```

</details>

## Deleting a canister

Deleting a canister removes the canister identifier, code, and state. The canister's source code will still be stored in your local environment and can be deployed as a new canister at any time. A canister must be stopped before it can be deleted.

:::tip
Any cycles remaining in the canister's balance will be returned to your developer identity.
:::

```
dfx canister delete PROJECT_NAME_backend --network=ic
```

## Stopping `dfx`

To stop `dfx`, simply use the `dfx stop` command.

For unresponsive `dfx` processes that are not stopped by `dfx stop`, you can use `dfx killall` to forcibly end them.

## Getting help

To view help information for `dfx`, you can use the `dfx help` command or view the [`dfx` reference documentation](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/).
