# Mainnet deployment

## Overview

To make your canister available to others, you must deploy it to the mainnet. 

If you are only deploying projects in a local development environment, see the [local development](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/local) scenario.

## Prerequisites

Before you download and install this release of the IC SDK, verify the following:

-   [x] You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local computer.

-   [x] You have `node.js` installed if you want to access the default frontend for the default project.

-   [x] You have ICP tokens or cycles available for you to use.

:::info
You must have **cycles** available to complete this guide. To get cycles, you must either convert ICP tokens to cycles or be provided cycles from another source, for example, from a canister controlled by another developer or from a third-party cycles provider. This guide assumes that you have an account with ICP tokens available and illustrates how to convert ICP tokens into cycles, then transfer those cycles to a **cycles wallet** that you control.

For information about how to get ICP tokens, see [how you can get ICP tokens](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/converting_icp_tokens_into_cycles).

For an introduction to using the Network Nervous System application to manage ICP tokens, see [Network Nervous System dapp quick start](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart).

For information about using your default cycles wallet after you have created it, see [use the default cycles wallet](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles-wallet).

## Check the connection to the mainnet

There is a reserved network alias that you can use to access the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet. The network alias is a system setting that’s defined internally, so there’s nothing you need to configure in your projects by default.

To check your connection to ICP:

- #### Step 1:  Check that you are in the root directory for your project, if needed.

- #### Step 2:  Check the current status of ICP and your ability to connect to it by running the following command for the network alias `ic`:

        dfx ping ic

- #### Step 3:  Verify that the `dfx ping ic` command returns information about ICP.

    For example, you should see output similar to the following:

        {
          "ic_api_version": "0.18.0"  "impl_hash": "d639545e0f38e075ad240fd4ec45d4eeeb11e1f67a52cdd449cd664d825e7fec"  "impl_version": "8dc1a28b4fb9605558c03121811c9af9701a6142"  "replica_health_status": "healthy"  "root_key": [48, 129, 130, 48, 29, 6, 13, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 97, 0, 129, 76, 14, 110, 199, 31, 171, 88, 59, 8, 189, 129, 55, 60, 37, 92, 60, 55, 27, 46, 132, 134, 60, 152, 164, 241, 224, 139, 116, 35, 93, 20, 251, 93, 156, 12, 213, 70, 217, 104, 95, 145, 58, 12, 11, 44, 197, 52, 21, 131, 191, 75, 67, 146, 228, 103, 219, 150, 214, 91, 155, 180, 203, 113, 113, 18, 248, 71, 46, 13, 90, 77, 20, 80, 95, 253, 116, 132, 176, 18, 145, 9, 28, 95, 135, 185, 136, 131, 70, 63, 152, 9, 26, 11, 170, 174]
        }

## Register, build, and deploy the application

After you have validated your cycles wallet balance, you can register, build, and deploy your sample application.

To deploy your first application on the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet:

- #### Step 1:  In your terminal shell, check that you are still in the root directory for your project.

- #### Step 2:  Ensure that `node` modules are available in your project directory, if needed, by running the following command:

        npm install

    For more information about this step, see [ensuring node is available in a project](/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/application-frontends/overview#troubleshoot-node).

- #### Step 3:  Register, build, and deploy your first application by running the following command:

        dfx deploy --network ic

    The `--network` option specifies the network alias or URL for deploying the dapp. This option is required to install on the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet.

    The `dfx deploy` command output displays information about the operations it performs.

    For example, this step registers two identifiers—one for the `hello_backend` main program and one for the `hello_frontend` frontend user interface—and installation information similar to the following:

        Deploying all canisters.
        Creating canisters...
        Creating canister "hello_backend"...
        "hello" canister created on network "ic" with canister id: "5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai"

          /index.js.LICENSE.txt (gzip) 1/1 (285 bytes)
        Deployed canisters.

    If you didn’t convert enough ICP tokens to cycles to complete the operation, you can add cycles to your cycles wallet by running a command similar to the following:

        dfx ledger --network ic top-up gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai --amount 1.005

    This command converts an additional `1.005` ICP tokens to cycles for the `gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai` cycles wallet identifier. The command returns output similar to the following:

        Transfer sent at BlockHeight: 81520
        Canister was topped up!

- #### Step 4:  Call the `hello_backend` canister and the predefined `greet` function by running the following command:

        dfx canister --network ic call hello_backend greet '("everyone": text)'

    Let’s take a closer look at this example:

    -   Using the `--network ic` option indicates that the canister you want to call is deployed on the `ic`. The `ic` network alias is an internally-reserved alias for accessing the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet.

    -   Note that the `--network ic` option must precede the operation subcommand, which, in this case, is the `dfx canister call` command.

    -   The `hello_backend` argument specifies the name of the canister you want to call.

    -   The `greet` argument specifies the name of the function you want to call in the `hello` canister.

    -   The text string `everyone` is the argument that you want to pass to the `greet` function.

- #### Step 5:  Verify the command displays the return value of the `greet` function.

    For example:

        ("Hello, everyone!")

- #### Step 6:  Rerun the `dfx wallet balance` command or refresh the browser to see your new cycle balance and recent activity.

## Test the dapp frontend

Now that you have verified that your dapp has been deployed and tested its operation using the command line, let’s verify that you can access the frontend using your web browser.

To access the dapp frontend:

- #### Step 1:  Open a browser.

- #### Step 2:  Navigate to the frontend for the dapp using a URL that consists of the `hello_frontend` identifier and the `boundary.icp0.io` suffix.

    If you didn’t make a note of the canister identifier, you can look it up by running the following command:

        dfx canister --network ic id hello_assets

    For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:

        https://gsueu-yaaaa-aaaae-aaagq-cai.icp0.io

    Navigating to this URL displays the HTML entry page for the template application. For example:

    ![HTML page with prompt](_attachments/net-frontend-prompt.png)

- #### Step 3:  Type a greeting, then click **Click Me** to return the greeting.
