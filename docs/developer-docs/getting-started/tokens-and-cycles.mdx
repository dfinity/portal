# Tokens and cycles

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Getting started", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

On the Internet Computer, there are three types of token assets: ICP tokens, cycles, and ICRC tokens. ICP and cycles are the most important for every developer to understand and use, as they are necessary for deploying and maintaining an application.

ICP tokens are important because they can be converted into cycles and used to pay for resource consumption. Cycles reflect the real cost of operations for applications hosted on the Internet Computer, including resources such as physical hardware, rack space, energy, storage devices, and bandwidth.

## ICP tokens

ICP is the Internet Computer's native utility token. Its value is determined on the open market. ICP tokens play a key role in both the governance and the economics of the Internet Computer.

There are three primary ways to use ICP tokens:

- Convert ICP into [cycles](#what-are-cycles), which are required to pay for a <GlossaryTooltip>canister's</GlossaryTooltip> resources. **All dapp developers will need to acquire cycles if they want to deploy their application onto the mainnet.**

- Trade ICP for other assets, such as other tokens.

- Stake ICP in a [neuron](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/neurons/neuron-overview) in return for network governance participation and rewards.

## Cycles

The Internet Computer runs on a network of nodes owned and operated by a community of independent node providers distributed across the globe. Node providers spend money to run and maintain nodes, such that they purchase hardware and pay for the electricity and network bandwidth used by the node. The Internet Computer compensates these node providers on a monthly basis by minting and distributing rewards in the form of ICP tokens.

To make ICP sustainable, canisters are required to pay for the resources they consume, including storage and compute. Resource consumption is not paid in ICP tokens but **cycles**. As the canister is used, its cycles balance is continuously reduced. Eventually, the canister needs to be "topped up" with more cycles. The canisterâ€™s developer is responsible for topping up the canister.

To get cycles, you must convert ICP tokens into cycles.

:::info Why are cycles different from ICP tokens?

While the value of an ICP token is volatile, cycles are not. Cycles are pegged to [XDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights), a group of fiat currencies. This allows resource consumption and canister execution on ICP to be a rather stable price.

## Other token types

The Internet Computer supports creating and deploying your own custom fungible or non-fungible tokens through the [ICRC standards](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/token-standards). Each ICRC standard defines a set of parameters that must be met to adhere to the standard. Not all ICRC standards are for tokens; some of them are for notifications, architectures, or other network functions.

## What is a ledger?

Anyone can deploy a custom token that adheres to an ICRC standard if they deploy a [ledger](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/ledger/overview) and [index](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/indexes) canister that implements the standard's requirements.

A **ledger** is a system canister used to store accounts and their transactions. Each developer identity has a **ledger account identifier**.

Each token on the Internet Computer has its **own** ledger. This means that there are separate ledgers for ICP tokens, cycles, and every ICRC token that has been deployed on the network.

## Converting ICP to cycles

### 1. Get your account's ledger account ID.

```
dfx ledger account-id
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
b0d7beee54be8679a42e999218a16a0d396f223d7e44d259ac089848c1b820bf
```

</details>

**Send ICP tokens to this ledger account ID.** You can obtain ICP tokens from an [exchange](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges) or through a [developer grant](https://dfinity.org/grants).

### 2. Check the balance.

```
dfx ledger balance --network ic
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
2.00000000 ICP
```

</details>

Converting ICP to cycles is done through the **cycles ledger**, a ledger canister that enables developer identities to directly convert, hold, send, and receive cycles.

The price of cycles is fixed against the price of [XDR](/docs/current/references/glossary#xdr), where 1 trillion cycles equals 1 XDR.

Cycles are measured in very large numbers, such as billions and trillions. When you talk about cycle transfers and replenishment, you will usually operate with trillions of cycles.

### 3. Convert ICP into cycles.

```
dfx cycles convert --amount AMOUNT --network ic
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
Transfer sent at block height 16146446
Using transfer at block height 16146446
Account was topped up with 6_229_700_000_000 cycles! New balance is 6_229_600_000_000 cycles.
```

</details>

:::info Calculating how many cycles you need

The amount of cycles that your application will use depends on a variety of factors. Cycles are charged for storage, compute, update messages, special features, and more. To get an approximation, you can view the [detailed cycles cost table](/docs/current/developer-docs/gas-cost) or use the [cycles pricing calculator](/docs/current/developer-docs/cost-estimations-and-examples).

:::

### 4. Confirm the balance.

```
dfx cycles balance --network ic
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
6.230 TC (trillion cycles).
```
