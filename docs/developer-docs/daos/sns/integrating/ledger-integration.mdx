## Overview

The SNS ledger canister keeps track of the transactions between accounts in a **chain**,
as well as the account balances at the last block of the chain.
A ledger canister is always deployed as part of the SNS canisters.
The ledger canister follows the [ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1) specification.
