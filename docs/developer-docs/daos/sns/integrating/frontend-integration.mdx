# SNS frontend integration

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

## Overview
There are different reasons why you might want to interface with an SNS project.
For example, you might want to integrate some of the SNS DAO functionality in the frontend of your dapp canister such that the dapp users can also vote on relevant SNS proposals (that govern and change the dapp) directly in the same application.
However, you might also consider interfacing with SNSs if you work on a project that builds a wallet dapp or DEX, for example to provide an interface to the SNS swap, the SNS governance, or the SNS ledger. 

## sns-js library
For interfacing with an SNS project, you can use the [sns-js library](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/blob/main/packages/sns/README.md).

`sns-js` can be utilized with two distinct approaches. 
The first approach is exploratory, where you only need to provide the SNS root canister ID of your SNS project to initialize a wrapper that handles routing the calls to the appropriate canister. This means having a single entry point for all functions.
The second approach, which is more common, involves instantiating the specific canisters you require.

Please refer to the following links to learn how to integrate with: 
* [SNS governance](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/blob/main/packages/sns/README.md#factory-snsgovernancecanister)
* [SNS root](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/blob/main/packages/sns/README.md#factory-snsrootcanister)
* [SNS swap](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/blob/main/packages/sns/README.md#factory-snsswapcanister)
* [SNS wrapper](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/blob/main/packages/sns/README.md#factory-snswrapper) which knows all SNSs and can therefore serve as a nice way to access different SNSs' data.
