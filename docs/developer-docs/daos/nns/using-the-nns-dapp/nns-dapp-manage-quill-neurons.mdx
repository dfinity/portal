## Overview
You may have neurons controlled by a principal ID that was created using [quill](../../../../../../docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/quill-cli-reference/quill-parent). In this case, it may be inconvenient to manage your neurons through the terminal. If you know the seed phrase of this principal ID, you can use a Ledger hardware wallet to manage your neurons through the [NNS dapp](/https://nns.ic0.app/).

## How to access neurons controlled by a principal ID created with quill
