Apart from regularly checking open proposals, here some relevant information for proposals submitted by the DFINITY foundation.

* You can find the code for the SNS governance, SNS root, and SNS swap in [the SNS repository](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/sns).
The SNS also uses the ICRC ledger suite, which you can find in [the Rosetta repository](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1).
* SNS upgrade proposals are announced in [this forum thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-upgrade-aggregation-thread/24259).
* You can find the instructions on how to verify that the Wasm in the proposal was indeed build from the provided `git commit` in the proposal's section "Wasm Verification" (see [this example proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/129633)).


## Verify application canister management proposals
If you are looking to verify [application canister management proposals]
(/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/proposals/proposal-topics#Topic:-`ApplicationCanisterManagement`),
apart from regularly checking open proposals, the following sections list some relevant information for
proposals submitted by the DFINITY foundation.


### Verify ledger upgrades for ckBTC, ckETH, and ckERC20

* For updates to the NNS canisters, you can follow [this repository](https://github.com/dfinity/ic).

More specifically, the following sub-directories are relevant:
- `rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger` for the ckBTC, ckETH, and ckERC20 ledgers, where `rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger:ledger_canister` is the Wasm relevant for the ckBTC ledger and `rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger:ledger_canister_u256.wasm` the Wasm for the ckETH and ckERC20 ledgers.

* You can find the instructions on how to verify that the Wasm in the proposal was indeed build from the provided `git commit` in the proposal.

### Verify ledger suite orchestrator canister upgrades
The ledger suite orchestrator manages all ledger suites of all ckERC20 tokens. That is the orchestrator can
upgrade managed canisters or add new ckERC20 tokens, see the [README](https://github
.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/ethereum/ledger-suite-orchestrator/README.adoc) for more details.

* The following
sub-directories in the [IC repository](https://github.com/dfinity/ic) are relevant:
- `rs/ethereum/ledger-suite-orchestrator`

* You can find the instructions on how to verify that the Wasm in the proposal was indeed built from the provided `git commit` in the proposal.

### Verify Internet Identity upgrades
* For updates to the [Internet Identity (II)](/docs/current/developer-docs/identity/internet-identity/overview) canister, you can find the code in [the II repository](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity).
* Each proposal points to the relevant commit that was used.
* You can find the instructions on how to verify that the Wasm in the proposal was indeed build from the provided `git commit` in the proposal itself (see for example the section "Wasm Verification" in [this example proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/129486)) and in the [Github release pages](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases).


### Verify Bitcoin canister upgrades
Please refer to the [Bitcoin canister documentation](https://github.com/dfinity/bitcoin-canister/blob/master/README
.md) for more information about the Bitcoin canister.

* You can find the code for the Bitcoin canister in [the `bitcoin-canister` repository](https://github.com/dfinity/bitcoin-canister).
* These proposals are not expected to happen frequently, but rather when there are important updates to be applied to the Bitcoin canister. You can expect that a new release will be cut in preparation of an upgrade in the above repository. See this [example release](https://github.com/dfinity/bitcoin-canister/releases/tag/release%2F2024-04-26).
* There are 2 Bitcoin canisters, one following the Bitcoin testnet and one following the Bitcoin mainnet network. The proposals will be specific to one of these canisters. Typically, you can expect that the proposal to upgrade the Bitcoin testnet canister happens 1 week before the one to upgrade the Bitcoin mainnet canister.
* You can find the instructions on how to verify that the Wasm in the proposal was indeed built from the provided `git commit` in the proposal's section "How can I verify the Wasm hash of this canister?" (see [this example proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/129499)).



## Verify IC operating system version election proposals

If you are looking to verify [IC PS version election proposals]
(/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/proposals/proposal-topics#Topic:-`IcOsVersionElection`), you
can refer to this video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z3rAQBkO8uI?si=AcIaAl51UN4bppIX" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can also consider the following information for proposals submitted by the DFINITY foundation:

* Each proposal submitted by the DFINITY foundation has a corresponding post on the forum (see [example](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-elect-new-release-rc-2024-05-01-23-01/30247)). Relevant posts can be found under the `Governance` category with the tags `replica` and `release`.
* The relevant code is available in [this repository](https://github.com/dfinity/ic).
* To verify that the code in the proposal is built from the specified `git commit`, follow the instructions in the [README file of the IC repository](https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases).
* Each proposal summary includes instructions for verifying the proposal payload. See this [example](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/130083). These steps are tested on Ubuntu 22.04, which is the recommended operating system for the verification process.

sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/ec35ebd252d4ffb151d2cfceba3a86c4fb87c6d6/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c ec35ebd252d4ffb151d2cfceba3a86c4fb87c6d6
```

* The reproducibility check script is versioned, cryptographically checksummed, and open-sourced, ensuring it cannot change post-submission. The proposal summary is immutable after submission. The upgrade image contents are cryptographically checksummed, and the checksum is included in the proposal payload and verified during the upgrade process.
* For GuestOS, DFINITY aims for a weekly release cycle, resulting in approximately one proposal per week plus additional feature builds.
* For HostOS, there is no fixed release cycle, but an upgrade is typically proposed every 3-6 months.
