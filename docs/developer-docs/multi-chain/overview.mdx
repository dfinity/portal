# Chain Fusion overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Chain Fusion"]} />

The Chain Fusion capabilities of the Internet Computer Protocol allow multiple
blockchains to interconnect in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need for
a single trusted intermediary. The key building blocks enabling this integration
are (1) a decentralized bi-directional communication of the Internet Computer
with other chains and (2) the ability of IC smart contracts to sign and submit
transactions to other chains.

Chain Fusion augments smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps) on
non-ICP chains with the unique capabilities of ICP, including:

- **Web2-like user experience**: Due to low cost, fast finality, and the reverse
  gas model, interacting with a smart contract on ICP closely resembles the user
  experience of traditional web services. By complementing non-ICP smart
  contracts with user interfaces served from ICP, the user can interact with
  these smart contracts using a standard browser, without installing a crypto
  wallet or relying on a single point of trust.

- **Performance**: Smart contracts on the IC possess the power to support a vast
  range of web services, from social networks to full-fledged AI models. Thus,
  Chain Fusion allows to build more powerful dapps combining non-ICP smart
  contracts with the decentralized compute power of ICP.

- **Storage**: Using a competitive pricing model, a single smart contract on ICP
  offers up to 400GiB of storage, enabling all application data to be stored
  on-chain. Through Chain Fusion, these decentralized storage capacities are
  made available to non-ICP dapps.

- **Autonomy**: Unlike traditional blockchains, smart contracts on ICP are
  capable of scheduling messages for themselves at any given interval. This
  functionality allows smart contracts to operate without the need for user
  inputs or arbitrage to maintain their services. Chain Fusion provides this
  autonomy to non-ICP smart contracts without sacrificing decentralization.

- **Interoperability with Web2**: ICP’s HTTPS outcall feature permits canisters
  to reach out to any web service in a replicated fashion, using deterministic
  response results. Chain Fusion brings this Web2-Web3 interoperability to
  non-ICP dapps.

The following examples illustrate the variety of use cases enabled by Chain
Fusion:

- **Trustless cronjob service**: Many Ethereum smart contracts depend on
  periodic activation of certain functions (such as loan liquidations, batching,
  etc.). These activations usually occur via arbitrageurs or external
  centralized services like Gelato.

- **A decentralized borrowing protocol**: A DeFi protocol issuing a stablecoin
  backed by the world-class asset Bitcoin as collateral.

- **Multi-chain asset DEX**: A decentralized exchange providing a uniform user
  experience, facilitating effortless and efficient trading of assets from
  different blockchains.

- **In-browser multi-chain wallet**: Similar to a DEX, a single browser-based
  wallet that manages assets from different and unrelated blockchains.

- **On-chain frontend**: Hosting an immutable or DAO-managed frontend for a
  smart contract on another blockchain.

- **Decentralized oracle**: Linking Web2 services and smart contracts on other
  blockchains via HTTPS outcalls.

### ICP smart contracts

Smart contracts on ICP are called canisters. In addition to unparalleled compute
and storage capabilities (see above), canisters can make use of protocol
primitives that are not natively available on other chains. For example:

- Canisters can request
  [randomness](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/management-canister/#retrieving-randomness)
  from the protocol, which is useful in applications where fairness or
  unpredictability is required.

- [Timers](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/periodic-tasks/)
  let canisters manage their tasks by initiating specific actions periodically
  without depending on any external actors.

- Full Web 2 integration allows canisters to both expose
  [HTTP interfaces](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/serving-http-request)
  and call
  [HTTP APIs hosted on the web](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/https-outcalls/making-http-requests).

### Key management and signing

A key feature of the IC protocol’s Chain Fusion capabilities is
[threshold signing](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/encryption/t-ecdsa/).
This feature allows canisters to control accounts on other blockchains. The
private keys that are used to sign transactions are never accesible in a single
physical place, but securely distributed as shares among a group of nodes
performing a threshold signing protocol to generate signatures on behalf of a
canister.

:::info Threshold signing is also referred to as
[chain-key cryptography](/docs/current/concepts/glossary/#chain-key). :::

### Integrations

A canister’s interaction with external blockchains requires submitting
transactions and reading the state of the other chain. ICP offers two types of
such integrations:

- **Direct integration**: In case of the Bitcoin integration, ICP nodes utilize
  a special component called the Bitcoin adapter to connect to the Bitcoin p2p
  network securely and independently. A set of ICP nodes effectively constitutes
  a native Bitcoin node.

- **Decentralized RPC integration**: When it comes to Ethereum integration, IC
  utilizes HTTPS outcalls to contact three separate JSON RPC providers (such as
  Ankr, BlockPI, Alchemy, and others) to retrieve the chain state and submit
  signed transactions.

### Whom do users trust?

A key question we must answer to fully understand the security of ICP's Chain
Fusion capabilities is: whom do users place trust in when using the presented
infrastructure?

ICP’s decentralization is rooted in the replicated execution and state of
canister smart contracts which depends on the honesty of a supermajority of
subnet
[nodes](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/overview-of-icp/#nodes).
These nodes are sourced from various identifiable and DAO-approved providers
that operate in globally distributed data centers.

In case of direct chain integration, the only trust assumption needed is that a
supermajority of subnet nodes are honest and in consensus. In case of
integration via RPC, users additionally need to trust RPC node providers. While
this is seen as less secure than a direct integration that involves running a
full node, it's currently deemed an acceptable trade-off (due to a reliance on
replicated results from multiple independent providers).

## How to build applications using Chain Fusion?

There are several building blocks available to augment non-ICP smart contracts
with ICP’s Chain Fusion capabilities or to leverage Chain Fusion in existing ICP
dapps:

- **Chain-key tokens**: Using the primitives described above, DFINITY has built
  two canisters implementing the [ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC) token
  standard to represent native Bitcoin and Ethereum tokens on ICP:
  [ckBTC](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/ckbtc) and
  [ckETH](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/ethereum/cketh). These tokens
  are digital twins of their corresponding native token and are backed 1:1 by
  the native assets which are managed 100% on-chain through a canister smart
  contract without any intermediaries.

- **[EVM RPC canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/ethereum/evm-rpc/evm-rpc-canister)**:
  A canister smart contract providing an on-chain API for communicating with
  [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) or any other
  [EVM blockchain](https://chainlist.org/?testnets=true).

- **[tECDSA signing](/docs/current/references/t-ecdsa-how-it-works/)**: An ICP
  service implementing the threshold ECDSA protocol by Groth and Shoup as
  described in their [Eurocrypt 2022 paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1330).

- **[HTTPS outcalls](/docs/current/developer-docs/security/security-best-practices/https-outcalls)**:
  Replicated calls into external web services.

- **[Bitcoin API](/docs/current/references/bitcoin-how-it-works/)**: A protocol
  API that allows canisters to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain directly.
