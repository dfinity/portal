# What is Chain Fusion?

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Chain Fusion"]} />

Chain Fusion allows the Internet Computer Protocol to interconnect with multiple
blockchains in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need for
a single trusted intermediary such as a bridge. This is possible through **decentralized bi-directional communication** of the Internet Computer
with other chains and the ability of ICP smart contracts to **sign and submit
transactions** to other chains.

Chain Fusion augments smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps) on
other chains with the unique capabilities of ICP, including:

- **Web2-like user experience**: Due to low cost, fast finality, and the reverse
gas model, interacting with a smart contract on ICP closely resembles the user
experience of traditional web services. By complementing non-ICP smart
contracts with user interfaces served from ICP, the user can interact with
these smart contracts using a standard browser, without installing a crypto
wallet or relying on a single point of trust.

- **Performance**: Smart contracts on the IC possess the power to support a vast
range of web services, from social networks to full-fledged AI models. Thus,
Chain Fusion allows to build more powerful dapps combining non-ICP smart
contracts with the decentralized compute power of ICP.

- **Storage**: Using a competitive pricing model, a single smart contract on ICP
offers up to 500GiB of storage, enabling all application data to be stored
onchain. Through Chain Fusion, these decentralized storage capacities are
made available to non-ICP dapps.

- **Autonomy**: Unlike traditional blockchains, smart contracts on ICP are
capable of scheduling messages for themselves at any given interval. This
functionality allows smart contracts to operate without the need for user
inputs or arbitrage to maintain their services. Chain Fusion provides this
autonomy to non-ICP smart contracts without sacrificing decentralization.

- **Interoperability with Web2**: ICP’s HTTPS outcall feature permits canisters
to reach out to any web service in a replicated fashion, using deterministic
response results. Chain Fusion brings this Web2-Web3 interoperability to
non-ICP dapps.

The following examples illustrate the variety of use cases enabled by Chain
Fusion:

- **Trustless cronjob service**: Many Ethereum smart contracts depend on
periodic activation of certain functions (such as loan liquidations, batching,
etc.). These activations usually occur via arbitrageurs or external
centralized services like Gelato.

- **A decentralized borrowing protocol**: A DeFi protocol issuing a stablecoin
backed by the world-class asset Bitcoin as collateral.

- **Multi-chain asset DEX**: A decentralized exchange providing a uniform user
experience, facilitating effortless and efficient trading of assets from
different blockchains.

- **In-browser multi-chain wallet**: Similar to a DEX, a single browser-based
wallet that manages assets from different and unrelated blockchains.

- **Onchain frontend**: Hosting an immutable or DAO-managed frontend for a
smart contract on another blockchain.

- **Decentralized oracle**: Linking Web2 services and smart contracts on other
blockchains via HTTPS outcalls.

### ICP smart contracts

Smart contracts on ICP are called canisters. In addition to unparalleled compute
and storage capabilities (see above), canisters can make use of protocol
primitives that are not natively available on other chains. For example:

- Canisters can request [randomness](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/management-canister/#retrieving-randomness) from the protocol, which is useful in applications where fairness or unpredictability is required.

- [Timers](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/periodic-tasks) let canisters manage their tasks by initiating specific actions periodically without depending on any external actors.

- Full Web 2 integration allows canisters to both expose [HTTP interfaces](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/https-outcalls/https-outcalls-overview) and call [HTTP APIs hosted on the web](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/https-outcalls/https-outcalls-how-to-use).

### Key management and signing

A key feature of the ICP’s Chain Fusion capabilities is [threshold signing](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/signatures/t-ecdsa/). This feature allows canisters to control accounts on other blockchains. The private keys that are used to sign transactions are never accessible in a single physical place, but securely distributed as shares among a group of nodes performing a threshold signing protocol to generate signatures on behalf of a canister.

:::info
Threshold signing is also referred to as [chain-key cryptography](/docs/current/references/glossary#chain-key).
:::

### Integrations

A canister’s interaction with external blockchains requires submitting transactions and reading the state of the other chain. ICP offers two types of such integrations:

- **Direct integration**: In case of the Bitcoin integration, ICP nodes utilize a special component called the Bitcoin adapter to connect to the Bitcoin p2p network securely and independently. A set of ICP nodes effectively constitutes a native Bitcoin node.

- **Decentralized RPC integration**: When it comes to Ethereum integration, IC utilizes HTTPS outcalls to contact three separate JSON RPC providers (such as Ankr, BlockPI, Alchemy, and others) to retrieve the chain state and submit signed transactions.

### Whom do users trust?

A key question we must answer to fully understand the security of ICP's Chain Fusion capabilities is: whom do users place trust in when using the presented infrastructure?

ICP’s decentralization is rooted in the replicated execution and state of canister smart contracts which depends on the honesty of a supermajority of subnet [nodes](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/network-overview#nodes). These nodes are sourced from various identifiable and DAO-approved providers that operate in globally distributed data centers.

In case of direct chain integration, the only trust assumption needed is that a supermajority of subnet nodes are honest and in consensus. In case of integration via RPC, users additionally need to trust RPC node providers. While this is seen as less secure than a direct integration that involves running a full node, it's currently deemed an acceptable trade-off (due to a reliance on replicated results from multiple independent providers).

## How to build applications using Chain Fusion

### Example code

To showcase how powerful Chain Fusion is, here is a simple example that shows three chains interacting in one smart contract: a single **ICP** smart contract that can have custody of **bitcoin** and programmatically trigger sending it based on events observed on an **Ethereum** DeFi smart contract.

This code snippet is written in both Rust and Motoko, but a similar example can also be written in TypeScript, Python, and other languages.

### Building blocks

There are several building blocks available to augment non-ICP smart contracts with ICP’s Chain Fusion capabilities or to leverage Chain Fusion in existing ICP dapps:

- **Chain-key tokens**: Using the primitives described above, DFINITY has built canisters implementing the [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC) token standard to represent native Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ERC-20 tokens on ICP: [ckBTC](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/chain-key-tokens/ckbtc/overview), [ckETH](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/chain-key-tokens/cketh/overview), and [ckERC20](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/chain-key-tokens/ckerc20/overview). These tokens are digital twins of their corresponding native token and are backed 1:1 by the native assets which are managed 100% onchain through a canister smart contract without any intermediaries.

- **[EVM RPC canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/ethereum/evm-rpc/evm-rpc-canister)**: A canister smart contract providing an onchain API for communicating with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) or any other [EVM blockchain](https://chainlist.org/?testnets=true).

- **[Threshold signatures](/docs/current/references/t-ecdsa-how-it-works)**: An ICP service implementing the threshold ECDSA and threshold Schnorr protocols.

- **[HTTPS outcalls](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/https-outcalls/https-outcalls-overview)**: Replicated calls into external web services.

- **[Bitcoin API](/docs/current/references/bitcoin-how-it-works)**: A protocol API that allows canisters to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain directly.
