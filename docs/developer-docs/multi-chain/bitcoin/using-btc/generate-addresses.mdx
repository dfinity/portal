# Generating a Bitcoin address

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Bitcoin"]} />

## Overview

For a canister to receive Bitcoin payments, it must generate a Bitcoin address.
In contrast to most other blockchains, Bitcoin doesn't use accounts. Instead, it
uses a UTXO model. A UTXO is an unspent transaction output, and a Bitcoin
transaction spends one or more UTXOs and creates new UTXOs. Each UTXO is
associated with a Bitcoin address, which is derived from a public key or a
script that defines the conditions under which the UTXO can be spent. A Bitcoin
address is often used as a single use invoice instead of a persistant address to
increase privacy.

## Bitcoin address types

Bitcoin uses multiple address types:

### Legacy addresses

These addresses start with a `1` and are called `P2PKH` (Pay to Public Key Hash)
addresses. They encode the hash of an ECDSA public key.

There is also another type of legacy address that starts with a `3` called `P2SH`
(Pay to Script Hash) that encodes the hash of a
[script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script). The script can define complex
conditions such as multisig or timelocks.

### SegWit addresses

SegWit addresses are newer addresses following the
[`Bech32`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki)
format that start with `bc1`. They are cheaper to spend than legacy addresses
and solve transaction malleability which is important for advanced use cases
like Partially Signed Bitcoin Transcations (PSBT) or the Lightning Network.
SegWit addresses can be of three types:

- `P2WPKH` (Pay to Witness Public Key Hash): A SegWit address that encodes the
  hash of an ECDSA public key.
- `P2WSH` (Pay to Witness Script Hash): A SegWit address that encodes the hash of
  a script.
- `P2TR` (Pay to Taproot): A SegWit address that can be unlocked by a Schnorr
  signature or a script.

## Generating a Bitcoin address

As mentioned above, a Bitcoin address is derived from a public key or a script.
To generate a Bitcoin address that can only be spent by a specific canister or a
specific caller of a canister, you need to derive the address from a canister's
public key available via the
[`ecdsa_public_key`](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-ecdsa_public_key) API.
The [basic Bitcoin example](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/basic_bitcoin) demonstrates how to generate a `P2PKH` address from a
canister's public key.

```motoko

/// Returns the P2PKH address of this canister at the given derivation path.
public func get_p2pkh_address(network : Network, key_name : Text, derivation_path : [[Nat8]]) : async BitcoinAddress {
    // Fetch the public key of the given derivation path.
    let public_key = await EcdsaApi.ecdsa_public_key(key_name, Array.map(derivation_path, Blob.fromArray));

    // Compute the address.
    public_key_to_p2pkh_address(network, Blob.toArray(public_key))
};

// Converts a public key to a P2PKH address.
func public_key_to_p2pkh_address(network : Network, public_key_bytes : [Nat8]) : BitcoinAddress {
    let public_key = public_key_bytes_to_public_key(public_key_bytes);

    // Compute the P2PKH address from our public key.
    P2pkh.deriveAddress(Types.network_to_network_camel_case(network), Publickey.toSec1(public_key, true))
};
