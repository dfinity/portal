## What is ckBTC?

Chain-key Bitcoin (ckBTC) is an [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-2/README.md)-compliant token that is backed 1:1 by BTC held 100% on the mainnet.

ckBTC does not rely on a centralized bridge to facilitate the conversion between BTC and ckBTC, which makes it substantially more secure when compared to other traditional 'wrapped' tokens.

ckBTC and BTC have the same value and can be swapped for one another seamlessly, however ckBTC has several advantages. ckBTC has faster transactions that are finalized within a few seconds, and ckBTC transactions on ICP are significantly cheaper than those on the Bitcoin network.

## How it works

The ckBTC functionality is provided through an interplay of two canisters:
- The **ckBTC minter**.
- The **ckBTC ledger**.

The **ckBTC ledger** is responsible for keeping account balances and for transferring ckBTC between accounts. It provides the following functionality:
- Enables the ckBTC minter to mint and burn ckBTC.
- Facilitates the transfer of ckBTC among users.

The **ckBTC minter** is responsible for the minting and burning of ckBTC tokens. It uses the following workflow:

- Tokens are minted when a user transfers bitcoins to a specific Bitcoin address under the ckBTC minter's control. The Bitcoin address uniquely identifies the owner of the sent bitcoins.

- The ckBTC minter waits for confirmations of all Bitcoin transactions that affect the total supply of ckBTC (because of the lack of finality in Bitcoin).

- For Bitcoin retrieval requests, the ckBTC minter burns ckBTC before transferring the corresponding BTC amount (minus fees) using a regular Bitcoin transaction.

A detailed description of the ckBTC minter can be found in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter).

A simplified overview of the process to mint and transfer ckBTC is depicted in the following figure.
