# Supported chains

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Chain Fusion"]} />

## Overview

A chain can be supported if it leverages an authentication method that is
supported by the threshold signing protocols of the Internet Computer, and has
reliable RPC providers supporting IPv6. For some chains, DFINITY or the
community has built libraries or canisters to simplify the integration.

## Selection of supported chains

The following table lists a selection of supported chains and their respective
authentication methods, available integrations, and chain-key tokens. EVM
compatible chains other than Ethereum are not listed explicitly, but they are
supported in the same way as Ethereum.

- **Authentication**: Authentication methods, i.e. signature schemes used to
  authenticate transactions, that are supported by the Internet Computer's
  threshold signing capabilities.

- **Available Integrations**: The available integrations for each chain, i.e.
  the methods by which the Internet Computer can interact with the chain.

- **Assets**: Assets build on top of the integrations, such as chain-key tokens.

:::note

Threshold Schnorr and EdDSA signing are not available in production yet.
Threshold Schnorr signing will be released with the Deuterium milestone
scheduled for August 2024. Threshold EdDSA signing will be released with the
Helium milestone later this year. However, both signing schemes are already
available as a [developer preview](https://github.com/domwoe/schnorr_canister).

## The chain you want to integrate is not listed?

Most likely, the chain you want to integrate is still supported by the Internet
Computer. Check the docs of the chain you want to integrate to find out which
authentication/signature schemes are supported.
