# Supported chains

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Chain Fusion"]} />

## Overview

Other blockchain networks can be integrated with ICP if they leverage an
authentication method that is supported by the threshold signing protocols of
the Internet Computer, and has reliable RPC providers supporting IPv6.

For some chains, DFINITY or the ICP community has built libraries or canisters
to simplify the integration.

## Supported chains

The following table lists a selection of supported chains and their respective
authentication methods, available integrations, and chain-key tokens.

:::caution EVM-compatible chains other than Ethereum are not listed explicitly,
but they are supported in the same way as Ethereum through the EVM RPC canister.
:::

- **Authentication**: Authentication methods, such as signature schemes used to
  authenticate transactions, that are supported by ICP's threshold signing
  capabilities.

- **Available integrations**: The available integrations for each chain, i.e.
  the methods by which ICP can interact with the chain.

- **Assets**: Assets build on top of the integrations, such as chain-key tokens.

:::caution

Threshold Schnorr and EdDSA signing are not available in production yet.
Threshold Schnorr signing will be released with the
[Deuterium milestone](https://internetcomputer.org/roadmap#Chain%20Fusion-Deuterium)
scheduled for August 2024. Threshold EdDSA signing will be released with the
[Helium milestone](https://internetcomputer.org/roadmap#Chain%20Fusion-Helium)
later this year. However, both signing schemes are already available as a
[developer preview](https://github.com/domwoe/schnorr_canister).

### Looking for a chain that is not listed?

Most likely, the chain you want to integrate is still supported by ICP. Check
the docs of the chain you want to integrate to find out which authentication
methods or signature schemes are supported.
