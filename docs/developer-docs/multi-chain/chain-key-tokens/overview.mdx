# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Chain fusion" ]} />

One common way that blockchain networks can enable cross-chain workflows is by 'wrapping' tokens. A wrapped token typically represents an underlying asset on a different blockchain, such as wrapped Bitcoin deployed on Ethereum. Traditional wrapped tokens involves an intermediary that needs to be trusted.

ICP uses a more secure alternative to wrapped tokens, known as **chain-key** tokens. Chain-key tokens are digital twin tokens created using ICP's chain-key cryptography protocols such as [threshold signing](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/concepts/glossary/#chain-key). Each chain-key token deployed on ICP and backed 1:1 with the native token held 100% on-chain by an ICP smart contract. There are no intermediaries or centralized bridges used in the chain-key token workflow.

Chain-key tokens can be swapped for one another seamlessly. Making transactions with chain-key tokens on ICP is often faster and cheaper than transactions on the token's native network.

## How to use chain-key tokens in a canister

Each implementation of a chain-key token uses the [ICRC](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC) token standard so that they can be easily integrated by services such as wallets and DEXs. To implement smart contracts that use chain-key tokens, simply make calls from a smart contract to the ICRC ledger for the chain-key token you wish to use. Using chain-key tokens does not require implementing a specific type of smart contract, and implementation is not restricted to a specific programming language.

## Available chain-key tokens

The current chain-key tokens are supported:

- [ckBTC](./ckbtc/overview.mdx): A 1:1 digital twin of Bitcoin.

- [ckETH](./cketh/overview.mdx): A 1:1 digital twin of Ethereum.
