# Pricing calculator

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />



To get a rough estimate of how much your project may cost, below is a pricing calculator that can be used to estimate the cost of a dapp deployed on ICP. Costs are charged to a canister in cycles, which are fixed against the price of [XDR](/docs/current/references/glossary#xdr), where **1 trillion cycles equals 1 XDR**.
Cycles costs are calculated based on:

- **Messaging**: Calls that are made to a canister's methods. Costs depend on the type of call being sent (query, update, inter-canister, etc.), the size of the message's request and response bytes, and the total number of messages a canister sends and receives.

:::info
Note that query calls are currently free and do not incur a cost.
:::

- **Execution**: Cycles are charged during execution of messages and tasks. There is a fixed fee for starting execution and a fee per executed instruction.

- **Storage**: Cycles charged for canister storage, both Wasm memory and stable memory.

- **Special features**: Include HTTPS outcalls, transmissions using the [Bitcoin API](/docs/current/references/bitcoin-how-it-works), and transmissions using the [chain-key signing API](/docs/current/references/t-sigs-how-it-works/).

## ICP pricing calculator

The calculator below estimates costs in USD, though your project will be charged in [cycles](gas-cost.mdx). Cycles have a fixed cost, where **1 trillion cycles equals 1 [XDR](/docs/current/references/glossary#xdr)**.

## How is the number of cycles charged to a canister estimated?

The number of cycles charged to the canister can be estimated using the following parameters:

- Nodes in the subnet the canister is deployed to: If deployed locally, this number is 1. If deployed on the mainnet, this number is either 13 or 34.
- Amount of users: The total number of users that interact with the canister.
- Daily active users: The total number of users that interact with the canister daily.
- Daily messages per active user: The total number of messages sent to the canister that each active user generates.
- Request and response bytes per message: The size of the request and response bytes per message.
- Instructions executed per message: The number of instructions that are executed in response to each message.
- Calls per message: The number of calls that are triggered per message.
- Request and response bytes per call: The size of the request and response bytes per call.
- Instructions per call: The number of instructions that are executed per call.
- Daily tasks: The number of daily tasks that the canister executes.
- Instructions executed per task: The number of instructions that are executed per daily task.
- Daily HTTPS outcalls: The number of daily HTTPS outcalls the canister makes.
- Request bytes per HTTPS outcall: The size of the request bytes per HTTPS outcall.
- Response bytes per HTTPS outcall: The size of the response bytes per HTTPS outcall.
- Storage bytes per user: The amount of data that is stored for each user.
- User-independent storage bytes: The amount of data the canister stores, independent of the storage used per user.

HTTPS outcalls are a special feature that is calculated differently than the other resources. Additionally, if a canister uses the [Bitcoin API](/docs/current/references/bitcoin-how-it-works) or makes transmissions using the [chain-key signing API](/docs/current/references/t-sigs-how-it-works/), there are additional cycle costs for these special feature transmissions.
