or following the instructions at <https://smartcontracts.org>.

## Claim your Cycles Wallet

### Step 1: Authenticate

will need to connect an active Twitter account to continue.

Click NEXT to continue.

### Step 2: Setup SDK

Once your eligibility has been confirmed, open up a terminal window.

If you already have created a project, go to the root of the project in the terminal, where the `dfx.json` file is located. If you haven't created a project yet, run these commands in the terminal:

    mkdir my_project && cd my_project
    echo '{ "dfx": "0.9.3" }' > dfx.json

Click NEXT to continue.

### Step 3: Create Canister and Claim Cycles

The `redeem` command shown on the screen contains a unique coupon code, which with this command will be used to create a canister and load it with 20T cycles.

After a successfully running the `redeem` command, the created canister's ID is returned. 

After runninng the `redeem` command, the created canister and it's balance can be checked using the status command. Use the canister ID returned by the `redeem` command:

    dfx canister --network=ic status <canister id>

Please note the canister ID is used in the next step, so write down the canister ID. 

Click NEXT to continue.

### Step 4: Set Wallet

The canister can now be linked to your principal ID as your wallet canister. The wallet is linked by calling a `dfx identity` command:
