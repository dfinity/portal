# Running in production

## Overview

When you are ready to deploy your project, this guide will help you have the most seamless possible launch or upgrade.

This page is an overview of the topic. For specific steps and troubleshooting information, please refer to the following pages:

* [Deploying and upgrading canisters](./deploying-and-upgrading.md).
* [Large web assembly modules](./larger-wasm.md).
* [Custom domains](custom-domain/custom-domain.md).
* [Instruction limits](./instruction-limits.md).
* [Computation and storage cost](../gas-cost.md).
* [Sharing links on Social Media](./social-sharing.md).

## Demonstrating trust

In the Internet Computer, a canister's source code cannot always be inspected, and at any point, a controller can replace the code running on the canister. Upgradeability is convenient and allows for continuous development, but it also creates risk for users who need to depend on the contract to be stable and trustworthy. Read [trust in canisters](/concepts/trust-in-canisters.md) for more information on this topic.

## How to upgrade safely

This is explored in depth in [Motoko upgrade compatibility](/motoko/main/compatibility.md).
