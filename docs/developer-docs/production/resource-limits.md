# Resource limits

## Overview

The Internet Computer uses WebAssembly as the platform for executing messages of smart contracts.
Since WebAssembly is [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), it can express different kinds of computations including non-terminating computations.
The Internet Computer protects against non-terminating computations by limiting the number of WebAssembly instructions and other resources per message execution.
The limits depend on the message type as shown in the following table.

## Resource constraints and limits

## Additional notes

The IC may reject WebAssembly modules for reasons such that:

- They declare more than 50_000 functions.
- They declare more than 1_000 globals.
- They declare more than 16 exported custom sections (the custom section names with prefix icp:).
- The number of all exported functions called `canister_update <name>` or `canister_query <name>` exceeds 1_000.
- The sum of `<name>` lengths in all exported functions called `canister_update <name>` or `canister_query <name>` exceeds 20_000.
- The total size of the exported custom sections exceeds 1MiB.

More information regarding these restrictions can be found in the [Internet Computer interface specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#system-api-module).
