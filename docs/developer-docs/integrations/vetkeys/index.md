# Overview

The vetKeys feature is in ongoing development on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It stands for ‘Verifiable Encrypted Threshold Keys’ and enables a number of cryptographic functionalities on ICP. The primary motivation for vetKeys is to facilitate onchain encryption, as such the primer is focused with that example in mind. .

To dive into the technical overview, please refer to the:

## Using vetKeys

As this feature is still in development, a brief demo for using the API exists. Instructions for this demo can be found [here](using-vetkeys.md).
