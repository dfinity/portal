# vetKeys API demo

## Overview

This demo provides a canister (`src/system_api`) that offers the [proposed vetKD system API](https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec/pull/158), implemented demonstration, testing, and initial development purposes. We stress that it does not offer security yet as no threshold cryptography is used yet to secure the key. 

This demo uses files found in [this repository](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/vetkd).

## Prerequisites

- [x] Download and install the IC SDK package as described in the [installing the IC SDK](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install/) page.
- [x] Download and install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
- [x] Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).


### Step 1: Begin by cloning the Github repository containing this project:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/examples/
cd examples/motoko/vetkd
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rust" label="rust" default>

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/examples/
cd examples/rust/vetkd
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Then, start a local instance of the Internet Computer:

```sh
dfx start --clean --background
```

### Step 3: Ensure the dfx uses the canister IDs that are hard-coded in the source code:

```sh
dfx canister create system_api --specified-id s55qq-oqaaa-aaaaa-aaakq-cai
```

Without this, the dfx may use different canister IDs for the `system_api` and `app_backend` canisters.

### Step 4: Ensure that the required node modules are available in your project directory:

```sh
npm install
```

### Step 5: Register, build and deploy the project:

```sh
dfx deploy
```

This command should finish successfully with output similar to the following one:

```sh
Deployed canisters.
