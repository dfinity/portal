# Deploy New ICRC-1 Token

This tutorial will guide you step-by-step to deploy your own [ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md) token to the Internet Computer.

## Deploy your ICRC-1 Ledger

1.  First, you need to download the icrc-1 ledger image (.wasm file) and the icrc-1 ledger interface (.did file). 

     ``` sh
     export IC_VERSION=1612a202d030faa496e1694eed98be4179fca856
     curl -o icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/$IC_VERSION/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz"
     curl -o icrc1-ledger.did "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/$IC_VERSION/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger/icrc1.did"
     gunzip icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz
    ```

    :::note

    The `IC_VERSION` variable is a commit hash from the <http://github.com/dfinity/ic> repository. To get the latest version, take the commit hash from the last blessed version from the [releases dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/releases). For newer releases, the deploy arguments for the ICRC1 ledger might change. To make sure that this guide works, please use the same `IC_VERSION` as specified in the above example.

    :::

2.  Ensure you use a recent version of `dfx`. If you donâ€™t have `dfx` installed, follow instructions on the [Installing the SDK](../../setup/install/index.mdx) section to install it.

3.  Add the following canister definition to the `dfx.json` file in your project:

    ``` json
    {
      "canisters": {
        "icrc1-ledger": {
          "type": "custom",
          "wasm": "icrc1-ledger.wasm",
          "candid": "icrc1-ledger.did"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

4.  Deploy the ledger canister to the IC:

    ``` bash
    # Change the variable to "ic" to deploy the ledger on the mainnet.
    export NETWORK=local

    # Change the variable to the principal that can mint and burn tokens.
    export MINTER_PRINCIPAL=$(dfx identity get-principal)

    # Change the variable to the principal that controls archive canisters.
    export ARCHIVE_CONTROLLER=$(dfx identity get-principal)

    export TOKEN_NAME="My Token"
    export TOKEN_SYMBOL=XMTK

    dfx deploy --network ${NETWORK} icrc1-ledger --argument '(variant { Init = 
         record {
           token_name = "'${TOKEN_NAME}'";
           token_symbol = "'${TOKEN_SYMBOL}'";
           minting_account = record { owner = principal "'${MINTER_PRINCIPAL}'";};
           initial_balances = vec {};
           metadata = vec {};
           transfer_fee = 10;
           archive_options = record {
             trigger_threshold = 2000;
             num_blocks_to_archive = 1000;
             controller_id = principal "'${ARCHIVE_CONTROLLER}'";
           }
    }})'
    ```

    where

    -   the `NETWORK` is the url or name of the replica where you want to deploy the ledger (e.g. use ic for the mainnet)

    -   the `TOKEN_NAME` is the human-readable name of your new token

    -   the `TOKEN_SYMBOL` is the ticker symbol of your new token

    -   the `MINTER_PRINCIPAL` is the Principal responsible for minting and burning tokens.

    -   the `ARCHIVE_CONTROLLER` is the [controller Principal](../../setup/cycles/cycles-wallet.md#controller-and-custodian-roles) of the archive canisters

    <div class="important">

    When you deploy to the mainnet:

    -   Make sure that the ledger canister has plenty of cycles. The canister will need cycles to spawn new archives. The exact number of cycles attached to `create_canister` messages is controlled by the `cycles_for_archive_creation` option.

    </div>

5.  Check that the Ledger canister is healthy. Execute the following command:

    ``` sh
    dfx canister --network ${NETWORK} call icrc1-ledger icrc1_symbol
    ```

    The output should look like the following:

        (record { symbol = "XMTK" })

Your new token is deployed and ready to be used.
