# SNS Integration

When planning an SNS launch, one topic to consider is whether and how the SNS functionality should be integrated in the dapp.
For example, one may want to embed a frontend for the SNS swap or for the SNS governance in the dapp's UI.
Other dapps can also provide such a frontend or integrate with some of the SNS canisters.
For example, DEXs might want to interact with the SNS ledger canisters or wallet dapps might want to provide an interface to interact with the different SNS governance canisters. 

As these considerations are not only relevant for the SNS launch but during the full SNS lifecycle, we explain them in this separate section.
