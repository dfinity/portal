# SNS index canister
## Overview
The index canister fetches transactions from the [ledger canister](ledger-integration.md) and indexes them by **account**. 
It allows to query the transactions of an account in descending order from the ledger chain, and the list of accounts that belongs to a **principal**. 
An index canister is always deployed as part of an SNS project.

This canister is useful for applications that want to show the transactions of a specific account.

Regularly (at each heartbeat), the index canister will query the transactions from
the ledger canister and then build the index of known transaction per account.

## Initialization

This sections explains how to deploy an index canister in isolation.
When the NNS creates a new SNS for a dapp, it will automatically be deployed with an SNS index canister.

The index canister initialisation requires the principal of the ICRC-1 ledger canister that should be indexed:

```
type InitArgs = record {
ledger_id : principal;
};
```

Example with `dfx`:

```shell
dfx deploy icrc1-index --argument "(record {
      ledger_id = principal \"rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai\"
    }
)"
```

## Usage

The provided methods are:

```
get_account_transactions : (GetAccountTransactionsArgs) -> (GetTransactionsResult);
```
- This method returns the transactions for a given account. Transactions are returned in descending id order.
Optionally, the user can specify a starting transaction id allowing to only query for transactions before this id. If no start is specified, the last transaction is used.

```
ledger_id : () -> (principal) query;
```
- This method returns the principal of the ledger canister being indexed.

```
list_subaccounts : (ListSubaccountsArgs) -> (vec SubAccount) query;
```
- This method lists all indexed subaccounts for a principal.
