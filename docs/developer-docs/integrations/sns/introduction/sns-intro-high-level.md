# SNS introduction

## Overview
A Service Nervous Systems (SNS) is an advanced form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
It is assumed that if you are reading this page you know what a DAO is and that you want to learn how
you can hand over your dapp to an SNS DAO.
If this is not (yet) the case, please refer to the [SNS page](/sns/) or the [high level introduction of how SNSs work](/how-it-works/sns/).

Any dapp on the Internet Computer can be handed over to an SNS with the result that the dapp is
owned and controlled by a community.
Each SNS includes a stake-based governance system, that orchestrates decision making and changes, and a ledger that defines a unique token for each SNS.
The SNS framework also comes with a defined path how an SNS is launched.
During a successful launch, an SNS is created, the governance control is distributed to users in a decentralization swap, initial funds are collected (in exchange for governance control), and the dapp's control is handed over to the new SNS.
