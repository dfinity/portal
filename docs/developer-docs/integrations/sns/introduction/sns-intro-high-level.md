# SNS introduction

## Overview
A Service Nervous Systems (SNS) is an advanced form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
We assume that if you are reading this page you know what a DAO is and that you want to learn how
you can hand over your dapp to an SNS DAO.
If this is not (yet) the case, you can learn more about DAOs and SNSs
[here](../tokenomics/index.md),
including what advantages such decentralized governance systems have.

Any dapp on the Internet Computer can be handed over to an SNS with the result that the dapp is
owned and controlled by a community.
Each SNS includes a stake-based governance system, that orchestrates decision making and changes, and a ledger that defines a unique token for each SNS.
The SNS framework also comes with a defined path how an SNS is launched.
During a successful launch, an SNS is created, the governance control is distributed to users in a decentralization swap, initial funds are collected (in exchange for governance control), and the dapp's control is handed over to the new SNS.
