# Launching an SNS

This section describes the SNS launch process in detail.
It begins with a detailed description of each stage of an SNS launch.
Then, it explains the practical commands and actions used throughout SNS launch, such as the tools and commands that are needed to take a project through each stage and launch an SNS for it.

In August 2023, the NNS voted to release a new version of the SNS with a new, simplified launch process. In particular, the new launch process only requires one single NNS proposal that will, if adopted, trigger the creation of the SNS canisters as well as starting and finishing the decentralization swap. Since the new flow is considerably more simple, both for developers who want to hand over their dapp to the IC and for voters/users, it is recommended to use the new flow.

As some dapp projects may have already started planning and testing the SNS launch process, the old legacy flow is still supported. Note that the legacy flow might be deprecated going forward.

Therefore, the developer documentation currently includes pages to describe both the legacy and the new flow.
The pages [stages of an SNS launch](./launch-summary-1proposal.md) and [commands and actions to go through SNS launch](./launch-steps-1proposal.md) define the new, recommended 1-proposal launch flow and how to go through it.
The pages [stages of an SNS launch - legacy flow](./launch-summary.md) and [commands and actions to go through SNS launch - legacy flow](./launch-steps.md) define the old, legacy flow that might be deprecated going forward.
