# Commands & actions to go through SNS launch

## Overview

At a high level, the stages for launching an SNS in production are explained [here](../launching/launch-summary-1proposal.md).

This article lists the technical commands and steps a developer needs to complete the stages for an SNS launch.

At a low level, the [SNS local testing repository](../testing/testing-locally.md) guides you
through the same, with the difference that the commands here target the canisters on the mainnet.

## Prerequisites:

- [x] Install the IC SDK. See: [installing the IC SDK](../../../setup/install).

- [x] Install `ic-admin`. See: [installing the `ic-admin`](../../../setup/ic-admin.md).

- [x] Install `sns` CLI.

:::note
The version of the sns CLI that is bundled with your dfx version may not have the latest commands described in the **Usage** section. If needed, it is recommended to build and use the sns CLI tool yourself.
:::

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dfinity/ic.git
cd ic
bazel build //rs/sns/cli:sns
ls bazel-bin/rs/sns/cli/sns 
```

## Stages

### 1. Dapp developers add NNS root as co-controller of dapp.

:::info
this article assumes if you start with adding the NNS root co-controller, that you have already tested the SNS process.
:::

They can do so by running the following command:

```bash
dfx sns prepare-canisters add-nns-root $CANISTER_ID
```

### 2. Dapp developers choose the initial parameters of the SNS for a dapp.

Typically, dapp developers choose initial parameters that will be used in subsequent proposals.

:::info 
These parameters also define the initial neurons with which the SNS governance canister will be installed. Before being fully launched, the SNS governance canister is in a pre-decentralization-swap mode and only few proposals are allowed (see Step 7). However, some SNS proposals might already be used during this time, for example upgrades to the dapp canister(s) while the launch is ongoing or registering custom proposals for that DAO. Such operations require submitting and adopting an SNS proposal during the launch process, and thus before the SNS is fully launched. Some frontends, for example the NNS frontend dapp, do not show neurons of SNSs that are not fully launched and thus neurons controlled by NNS frontend dapp principals will only be visible after a successful launch. Therefore, the initial neurons must be carefully setup in a way so that enough of them can be operated already during the launch process. 
:::

### 3. Submit NNS proposal to create SNS.

Anyone who owns an eligible NNS neuron with enough stake can submit an NNS proposal to create an SNS for a given dapp.
Of course it is crucial to set the right parameters in this proposal.
You can also find an example of how this command is used [here](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing/blob/main/propose_sns.sh).


:::info
Note that there can only be one such proposal at a time in the NNS. This means that the time when this proposal can be submitted might depend on other SNS' launch.
:::

To create such a proposal, a common path is to use `sns-cli` and run the following:

```bash
dfx sns propose --network ic --neuron $NEURON_ID sns_init.yaml
```

### 4. The NNS proposal is decided.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. Community votes.

### 5. (Automated) SNS-W deploys SNS canisters.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

### 6. (Automated) SNS-W sets SNS root as sole controller of dapp.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

### 7. (Automated) SNS-W initializes SNS canisters according to settings from Step 1.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

### 8. (Automated) SNS swap starts.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

### 9. (Automated) SNS swap ends.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.

### 10. (Automated) SNS swap finalizes.

Nothing technical for dapp developers to do. This is triggered automatically as a result
of an adopted proposal in Stage 4.
