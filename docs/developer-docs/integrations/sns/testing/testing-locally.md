# Testing SNS locally

## Overview

To help developers, DFINITY has created the `sns-testing` repo which has scripts that help developers test the SNS process. Developers can run a local version of the Internet Computer on their local machine, deploy their dapp locally and run through [the stages](../launching/launch-summary.md) of decentralizing their dapp. 

After having [chosen the initial SNS parameters in a .yaml file](../tokenomics/preparation.md) and before requesting an SNS launch in production, the SNS launch should be tested locally.

**The main intent of `sns-testing` repo is for a developer to test the actual process of decentralizing their dapp.**

Among other things, developers can use `sns-testing` repo to: 
* Initiate proposals.
* Pass proposals.
* Start decentralization swaps.
* Upgrade dapp via DAO voting.

:::info
`sns-testing` is just one form of testing SNS process locally. Developers should feel free to use others, fork/modify `sns-testing` or create their own.
:::

## Using the `sns-testing` repo

These scripts have been most tested with a stack that looks like this:

* A single canister that is being decentralized.
* A canister that can be deployed to local replica via `dfx deploy`.

## Testing via `sns-testing` repo
To use the `sns-testing` commands and their arguments properly, please consult the `sns-testing` [README](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing#sns-lifecycle).

:::info
If you have started using `sns-testing` before August 2023 and are using the old legacy flow of launching an SNS (please see [here](../launching/index.md) for more context), please continue your work with the legacy documentation on [this old README](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing/blob/v1-legacy/README.md). In particular, 
* If you were following the Apple silicon-only instructions, please switch to the `v1-legacy` Git tag.
* If you were using the Docker-based deployment approach, please use the docker image: `docker pull ghcr.io/dfinity/sns-testing:v1-legacy`.

### Testing stages of the SNS launch process

For simplicity, next we map the stages introduced in the [SNS launch stages documentation](../launching/launch-summary-1proposal.md) and in the documentation [commands and actions to go through SNS launch](../launching/launch-steps-1proposal.md) to the relevant scripts in the `sns-testing` repo so you can learn what part of the launch is tested in which script.
Note that some developers have dapps that do not match the narrow cases of `sns-testing` so the table also includes a column for what other developers have experienced.

### Testing the upgrading and managing of an SNS

Once a canister or dapp has been handed over to an SNS, it will be updated via proposals and voting. Developers can test this flow by [using commands from `sns-testing`](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing#sns-lifecycle).


<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Action</th>
        <th>Example in `sns-testing`</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Upgrade a yet-to-be-decentralized canister by submitting an SNS proposal that can be voted on using the SNS developer neuron.</td>
        <td><code>./upgrade_test_canister.sh</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Submit proposal to upgrade a decentralized canister</td>
        <td><code>./upgrade_test_canister.sh]</code></td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>Vote on a proposal that upgrades a decentralized canister</td>
        <td><code>./vote_on_sns_proposal.sh</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

You might also want to test integrations and basic SNS functionality. 
For this purpose you can use the above instructions after the test SNS is 
launched or use the [SNS testflight on mainnet](testing-on-mainnet.md).
