# SNS governance

## Overview
<!-- TODO-content: 
Intro
* In general, there are two main ways to interact with an SNS: some FE & sns-quill.
** quill is more secure because ...
** FE might exist also in the dapp (e.g., OC). To learn more about those, refer to the 
respective projects (potentially refer to doc that explains OC voting.
Here we explain NNS FE dapp UI.
* Note that some interactions are only possible on sns-quill, especially in the first
version of SNS

## Prerequisites 
If you want to use quill, you also need to download sns-quill as explained
[here](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-quill#download).

## Getting SNS neurons {#getting-neuron}
<!-- TODO-content:
Before participating, you need a neuron.
Two ways to get one
1) participate in the SNS decentralization swap and getting SNS neurons.
2) (once liquid tokens) have SNS tokens and stake them.
-->

### Adding `hot keys' to neurons from the decentralization swap {#adding-hot-key}
<!--  TODO-content:
In the initial version, can participate in the swap on the FE and will see the neurons.
Can add hot key (explain what that is) but cannot do much more yet.
For how to participate in swap, refer to this page. 
Then explain here how to add a hot key to allow other principals to manage the neuron.
