# SNS rewards

Each SNS can be individually configured with parameters that define, among other things,
how and SNS uses rewards to incentivice certain behavior for the governance participants
and the dapp users.

## Rewards Overview

The goal of this article is to explain the design of the SNS reward scheme.

The full potential of tokenization can be unlocked by a tokenized open governance system,
where tokens can be staked to participate in voting. Anyone with staked tokens 
can submit and vote on governance proposals for the dapp.

By participating in governance, developers, users, and other investors can collectively 
decide what new features should be implemented in the dapp that is governed by the SNS.
As their tokens are stacked, they will be incentivized to vote taking into consideration
the future value of the tokens and the dapp. This represents the first simple scheme for
SNS rewards. Based on the collected experience from developers and the community, this
can be enhanced in the future.

We consider two categories of rewards:
  * **Voting rewards** to incentivize users to take part in SNS governance.

  * **User rewards** to incentivize dapp users to become early adopters and active users of the dapp that is governed by the SNS.

The reward scheme is based on the voting rewards used in the
[Network Nervous System (NNS)](https://medium.com/dfinity/the-network-nervous-system-governing-the-internet-computer-1d176605d66a#:~:text=Network%20Nervous%20System%20overview,how%20to%20update%20this%20information.),
which however can be flexibly configured by each SNS.

## Recap on NNS voting rewards

The [NNS](/tokenomics/nns/nns-intro.md) is the DAO that governs the Internet Computer.
Within the NNS, voting rewards are paid out on a regular basis (currently daily),
based on an overall reward pool for that time period. 
Each neuron receives a pro-rata amount of that pool according to the voting power with 
which the neuron voted and in how many proposals the neuron participated. More precisely,
this works as follows:

* Determination of the total reward pool:
  * For a time t between G (genesis time) and G + 8y the annualized reward as a percentage of total supply is R(t) = 5% + 5% [(G + 8y – t)/8y]²
  * For a time t after G+8y, we have R(t) = 5%.
  * The total pool of voting rewards for a given day is calculated as ICP supply (total supply of ICP tokens on that day) * R(t) / 365.25.
* Voting power of neurons:
  * Only neurons with a dissolve delay of more than 6 months are eligible for voting. The maximum dissolve delay is 8 years.
  * The voting power of a neuron is computed as `neuron_stake * dissolve_delay_bonus * age_bonus`
  * In particular the dissolve delay bonus and the age bonus are cumulative.
  * The dissolve delay bonus (ddb) is a value between ddb<sub>min</sub> =1 and ddb<sub>max</sub>=2 and a linear function of the dissolve delay (capped at eight years).
  * The age bonus (ab) is a value between ab<sub>min</sub>=1 and ab<sub>max</sub>=1.25 and a linear function of the age of the neuron (capped at four years). A neuron starts aging when it enters a locked state. Aging is reset to 0 when a neuron enters a dissolving state.
  * The voting power is calculated when the proposal is made, not when the ballot is cast.

* Allocation of reward pool to neurons:
  * The reward pool is allocated in proportion to the voting power of proposals that are settled on this day multiplied by the reward weight of the according proposal category.
    * Determine the set of proposals that are included in this reward period (typically a day): these are the proposals that are not yet settled with respect to voting rewards, and no longer open for voting.
    * The total voting power by neurons who were eligible for voting is added up.
    * Each neuron is rewarded in proportion to the voting power it contributed to these proposals multiplied by the reward weight of the according proposal category.
  * When a neuron is rewarded for voting, these rewards are recorded in an attribute of the neuron that is called maturity which is not a tradable asset. If a user wants to generate income from maturity, he/she needs to burn maturity to create new ICP via spawning a neuron which is a non-deterministic process described [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Maturity_modulation).

## Design of SNS rewards

### Voting rewards

As highlighted in the background section above, the SNSs leverage the NNS voting reward scheme 
and allow for flexibility to configure the scheme. Hence, in the following we go through the
features of the NNS and describe how it is adapted and made configurable for the SNS. 
Unless otherwise stated, the approach and formula are the same as for the NNS. 
As for the NNS, it is possible to change the SNS configuration by an SNS governance proposal.

#### Determination of the total reward pool
  * The impact of changing the parameters of the reward function can be simulated in this [tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cTqgjGcG5rEQ5kRGprpdLvBL7ZdTqUDCuCi0QjClbgk/edit#gid=0).

* Reward minimum r<sub>min</sub>: rational value greater than or equal to 0. Default value: 0.00.
* Reward maximum r<sub>max</sub>: rational value greater than or equal to r<sub>min</sub>. Default value: 0.00.
* Start time for paying out rewards t<sub>start</sub>: timestamp greater than or equal to genesis time of the SNS. The start time is set to the current time once the reward calculation is switched on.
* Time length t<sub>delta</sub> which is greater than or equal to 0 and which determines the time transition length between r<sub>max</sub> and r<sub>min</sub>. Default value: 0 years.
* For a time t between t<sub>start</sub> and t<sub>start</sub>+t<sub>delta</sub> the annualized reward as a percentage of total supply is R(t) = r<sub>min</sub>+ (r<sub>max</sub>-r<sub>min</sub>) [ (t<sub>start</sub>+ t<sub>delta</sub> – t) / t<sub>delta</sub> ]²
* For a time t after t<sub>start</sub>+t<sub>delta</sub>, we have R(t) = r<sub>min</sub>
* For the special case r<sub>max</sub> = r<sub>min</sub> the reward function is constant, namely R(t)=r<sub>min</sub>
* The total pool of voting rewards for a given day is calculated as SNS supply (total supply of SNS tokens) * R(t) / 365.25.
* Voting rewards are minted, i.e. generating new supply once the according maturity is converted to the SNS token. In case that the SNS would like to stop a token supply increase after t<sub>start</sub>+t<sub>delta</sub> the SNS should set r<sub>min</sub>=0.

#### Voting power of neurons
  * Required minimum dissolve delay for voting dd<sub>min</sub>: integer value greater than or equal to zero. Default value: 6 months.
  * Maximum dissolve delay dd<sub>max</sub>: integer value greater than or equal to dd<sub>min</sub>. Default value: 8 years.
  * Maximum dissolve delay bonus:
    * ddb<sub>max</sub> rational value greater than or equal to 1. Default value: 2.
    * The special case ddb<sub>max</sub>=1 results in no dissolve delay bonus.
  * Maximum age a<sub>max</sub>: integer value greater than or equal to 0. Default value: 4 years.
  * Maximum age bonus
    * ab<sub>max</sub> rational value greater than or equal to 1. Default value: 1.25.
    * The special case ab<sub>max</sub>=1 results in no age bonus.
#### Allocation of reward pool
  * The reward pool is allocated in proportion to the voting power of proposals that are settled on this day (same as for the NNS).
  * If on a particular day no proposal was submitted then rewards will be carried over to the next day.
  * NNS has reward weights for different proposal types. For the first version of the SNS reward scheme this functionality is not yet available.

There is a flag which activates the calculation and distribution of voting rewards, as an SNS might choose to go through a ramp-up period without voting rewards, or with no voting rewards at all.

### Setting voting reward parameters

Voting reward parameters are defined in the SNS governance canister and can be changed by proposal. Details on the data structure **VotingRewardsParameters** used in the implementation are [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/sns/governance/proto/ic_sns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L726).

In the following table we provide an overview of all relevant parameters of **VotingRewardsParameters**, linking the notation of this article to full names used in the implementation.

|Parameter|Full name in *VotingRewardsParameters*|
| --- | --- |
|r<sub>min</sub>|*initial_reward_rate_basis_points*|
|r<sub>max</sub>|*final_reward_rate_basis_points*|
|t<sub>start</sub>|*start_timestamp_seconds*|
|t<sub>delta</sub>|*reward_rate_transition_duration_seconds*|

When **VotingRewardsParameters** is not populated, voting rewards are disabled.

In the following we provide an overview of the relevant parameters for the determination of voting power.

|Parameter|Full name in *VotingRewardsParameters*|
| --- | --- |
|dd<sub>min</sub>|*neuron_minimum_dissolve_delay_to_vote_seconds*|
|dd<sub>max</sub>|*max_dissolve_delay_seconds*|
|ddb<sub>max</sub>|To be added, once implemented.|
|a<sub>max</sub>|*max_neuron_age_for_age_bonus*|
|ab<sub>max</sub>|To be added, once implemented.|

### User rewards

* The purpose of user rewards is to foster early adoption and active usage of the SNS. Given that the meaning of usage and the according user rewards can vary greatly across individual SNSs we have a very simple set-up at start.
* Some tokens (reserved for user rewards) can be held in an account that is owned by an SNS-controlled canister. This canister can then codify when the rewards are paid out and to whom.
* This solution allows paying out existing (not newly minted) tokens. If it is required that user rewards trigger minting, this could be added in a later phase.
