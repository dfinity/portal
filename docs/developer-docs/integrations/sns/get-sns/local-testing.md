# SNS local testing

After having
[chosen the initial SNS parameters in a .yaml file](../tokenomics/preparation.md)
and before requesting an SNS launch in production,
the SNS launch should be tested locally.
A detailed description of how to run through [all the steps included
in an SNS launch](../lifecycle-sns/sns-launch.md) locally can be
found in [this repository](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing).
You might also want to test integrations and basic SNS functionality. 
For this purpose you can use the above instructions after the test SNS is 
launched or use the [SNS testflight](testflight.md).
