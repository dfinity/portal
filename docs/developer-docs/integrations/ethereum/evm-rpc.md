# EVM RPC canister

To use the EVM RPC canister, you can import it into your project's `dfx.json` file:

```json
{
 "canisters": {
   "evm_rpc": {
     "type": "custom",
     "candid": "https://github.com/internet-computer-protocol/ic-eth-rpc/releases/latest/download/evm_rpc.did",
     "wasm": "https://github.com/internet-computer-protocol/ic-eth-rpc/releases/latest/download/evm_rpc_dev.wasm.gz",
     "remote": {
       "id": {
         "ic": "a6d44-nyaaa-aaaap-abp7q-cai"
       }
     }
   }
 }
}
```

## Supported RPC methods

- `eth_feeHistory`: Queries the historical fee data to estimate gas prices for transactions.
- `eth_getLogs`: Queries the logs of a specified block or transaction.
- `eth_getBlockByNumber`: Queries information about a given block.
- `eth_getTransactionCount`: Queries the number of transactions for a specified address.
- `eth_getTransactionReceipt`: Queries details about a submitted transaction.
- `eth_sendRawTransaction`: Submits a signed transaction to the Ethereum network.

Other JSON-RPC methods (including those specific to non-Ethereum networks) may be accessed using the canister's `request` method.


## Supported RPC providers

The EVM RPC canister has built-in support for the following [Ethereum JSON-RPC providers](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc):

- Alchemy: `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/`
- Ankr: `https://rpc.ankr.com/eth/`
- BlockPI: `https://ethereum.blockpi.network/v1/rpc/`
- Cloudflare Web3: `https://cloudflare-eth.com/v1/mainnet/`
- Public Node: `https://ethereum.publicnode.com`

View the [full list of RPC providers for each EVM network.](https://chainlist.org/)

### Custom JSON-RPC requests

Send a raw request to a custom JSON-RPC API with the `request` method:

```
dfx canister call evm_rpc --wallet $(dfx identity get-wallet) --with-cycles 600000000 request '(variant {Custom={url = "https://ethereum.publicnode.com"}},"{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_gasPrice\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}",1000)'
```

You can also specify an RPC provider using a specific EVM chain or RPC provider:

```
type JsonRpcSource = variant {
  Chain : nat64;
  Provider : nat64;
  Custom : record { url : text; headers : vec (text, text) };
};

request : (
  source : JsonRpcSource,
  jsonRequest : text,
  maxResponseBytes : nat64
) -> (
  Result<text, RpcError>
);
```

### Registering your own provider

To register your own RPC provider, you can use the following command:

```
dfx canister call evm_rpc register_provider '(record { chain_id=1; base_url="https://cloudflare-eth.com"; credential_path="/v1/mainnet"; cycles_per_call=10; cycles_per_message_byte=1; })'
```

In this command, the following configuration parameters are set:

- `chain_id`: The ID of the blockchain network.
- `base_url`: The JSON-RPC base URL. 
- `credential_path`: The path to the RPC authentication.
- `cycles_per_call`: The amount of cycles charged per RPC call.
- `cycles_per_message_byte`: The amount of cycles charged per message byte. 


Then, to authorize with this provider in your local environment, run the commands:

```
PRINCIPAL=$(dfx identity get-principal)
dfx canister call evm_rpc authorize "(principal \"$PRINCIPAL\", variant { RegisterProvider })"
dfx canister call evm_rpc get_authorized '(variant { RegisterProvider })'
```

To deauthorize the provider locally, run the command:

```
dfx canister call evm_rpc deauthorize "(principal \"$PRINCIPAL\", variant { RegisterProvider })"
```


### Using a specific EVM chain

To use a specific EVM chain, specify the chain's ID in the `Chain` parameter:

```
dfx canister call evm_rpc --wallet $(dfx identity get-wallet) --with-cycles 600000000 request '(variant {Chain=0x1},"{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_gasPrice\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}",1000)'
```


## Using the EVM RPC canister 

To use the canister locally, start the local replica and deploy the canister locally with `13` subnets to simulate deployment on the mainnet:

```
dfx start --background
dfx deploy evm_rpc --argument '(record { nodesInSubnet = 13 })'
```

To use the canister on the mainnet, deploy it with the `--network ic` flag:

```
dfx deploy evm_rpc --network ic
```
