# Installing the IC SDK

## Overview

The [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk) is a **software development kit** used for creating and managing canister smart contracts on the ICP blockchain. The IC SDK supports [Motoko](../../backend/choosing-language) and [Rust](../../backend/choosing-language) programming languages by default, but [developers can use other languages as well](../../backend/choosing-language).

## Components of the IC SDK

The IC SDK installation script installs several components in default locations on your local computer. The following table describes the development environment components that the installation script installs:

| Component    | Description                                                                                        | Default location                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| dfx          | Command-line interface (CLI)                                                     | `/usr/local/bin/dfx`                          |
| moc          | Motoko runtime compiler                                                                            | `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/<VERSION>/moc`     |
| replica      | Internet Computer local network binary                                                             | `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/<VERSION>/replica` |
| uninstall.sh | Script to remove the SDK and all of its components                                    | `~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh`               |
| versions     | Cache directory that contains a subdirectory for each version of the SDK you install. | `~/.cache/dfinity/versions`                   |

### IC SDK vs CDK vs `dfx`

There are a few components worth expanding on:

1. **IC SDK**: this is the SDK created by DFINITY for creating and managing canisters. This is just one SDK in the ICP community and a common entry point for developers.

2. **Canister Development Kit (CDK)**: a CDK is an adapter used by the IC SDK that provides a programming language with the features necessary to create and manage canisters. 
The IC SDK comes with a few CDKs already installed for you so you can use them in the language of your choice. For example, the IC SDK comes with the [Rust CDK](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs) already installed. 
CDKs that are not installed but available for developers include the:
  - [Python CDK](https://demergent-labs.github.io/kybra/).
  - [TypeScript CDK](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/). 
  - [C++ CDK](https://docs.icpp.world/).
  
Since CDKs are components used by the SDK, some developers choose to use the CDK directly (without the IC SDK), but typically are used as part of the whole IC SDK.

3. **dfx**: `dfx` is the command-line interface for the IC SDK. This is why many commands for the IC SDK start with the command "`dfx ..`" such as `dfx new` or `dfx stop`.

## Installing the IC SDK

You can download and install the latest version of the [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk) for creating and managing canister smart contracts by running the command below. The following topics provide additional information about installing, upgrading, and removing the IC SDK.

The **IC SDK** is natively supported on Linux or macOS 12.\* Monterey or later. 

There is no native support for <code>dfx</code> on Windows. However, by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), you can run dfx on a Windows system as described below.

:::caution
Not all features of dfx may be supported on WSL 2.

    <h3 id="permission-denied-when-running-dfx-start-">Permission denied when running <code>dfx start</code></h3>
    <p>Projects created from <code>dfx</code> need to be on the Linux filesystem instead of the Windows filesystem.

      creating projects in there should work.</p>
    <h3 id="no-internet-access-on-wsl">No internet access on WSL</h3>
    <p>If you don’t have internet access on WSL, for instance you cannot ping any server successfully, most likely the
      nameserver on WSL is set to an internal WSL proxy. You can check the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to see if
      it’s the case. If it’s true, please follow the below steps to set to a valid nameserver: <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Create the <code>/etc/wsl.conf</code> file and add the below content to it, this will prevent WSL from
          regenerating the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file after restarting.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
      <CodeBlock language="toml">
{`[network]
generateResolvConf = false`}
      </CodeBlock>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 2: Modify the nameserver in the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to a valid one, for example the Google
          nameserver <code>8.8.8.8</code>. </li>
        <li>Step 3: On Windows, restart WSL to let this fix take effect.</li>
        <code>wsl.exe --shutdown</code>

## Core components in a versioned directory

The `~/.cache/dfinity/versions` directory stores one or more versioned subdirectories of the SDK. Each versioned subdirectory contains the all of the directories and files required for a specific version of the SDK. For example, if you list the contents of the `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/0.9.3` directory you would see the following core components:

### Motoko base directory

The `base` directory in the versioned subdirectory of the SDK contains the Motoko base library modules that are compatible with that version of the SDK. Because the Motoko base library is evolving rapidly, you should only use the base modules that are packaged with the version of the SDK that you have installed.

### Bootstrap directory

The `bootstrap` directory contains web server code that is deprecated. Beginning with version 0.7.0, agents can call an HTTP middleware server instead of the `bootstrap` code. This change enables canisters to respond to HTTP requests directly and operate more like traditional web-based applications.

## Using the dfx version manager

Alteratively, you can upgrade or install a specific version of dfx, the dfx version manager (`dfxvm`) can be used. 

First, install `dfxvm` using the following `curl` command:

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/sdk/dfxvm-install-script/install.sh)"
```

Upon installation, you will be prompted to select which version of dfx you'd like to install. Alternatively, you can pass the intended version using an environment variable, such as:

```
DFX_VERSION=0.15.1 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/sdk/dfxvm-install-script/install.sh)"
```

### Installing a specific version

Once `dfxvm` is installed, you can install other specific versions of dfx using the command:

```
dfxvm install [VERSION_NUMBER]
```

For example, you can install `0.15.0` with the command:

```
dfxvm install 0.15.0
```

### Uninstalling a specific version

To uninstall a version of dfx using `dfxvm`, use the command:

```
dfxvm uninstall [VERSION_NUMBER]
```

For example, to uninstall version `0.14.4`, use the command:

```
dfxvm uninstall 0.14.4
```

### Upgrading to the latest version

To update dfx to the latest version, use the command:

```
dfxvm update
```

### Setting a default version

If defined, the IC SDK will always run the version specified in the project's `dfx.json` in the key `"dfx"`.
For example, if your `dfx.json` contains `"dfx": "0.11.1"`, any `dfx` command you run within this project's directory will be executed by `dfx` of version `0.11.1`.
Should the defined version not be installed (e.g. because you cloned a repo that was created for a different version than you have installed locally), `dfx` will report an error.

:::info
You can learn more about `dfxvm` [here](https://github.com/dfinity/dfxvm/tree/main).
:::

## Building from source

If you would like to compile dfx by yourself, head over to the [IC SDK repo](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk). The README contains the instructions how you can build it on your own.

## Uninstalling the IC SDK

When you install the IC SDK, the installation script puts the required binary files in a local directory and creates a cache. You can remove the IC SDK binaries and cache from your local computer by running the `uninstall` script located in the `.cache` folder.

For example:

``` bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh
```

If you are uninstalling because you want to immediately reinstall a clean version of `dfx`, you can run the following command:

``` bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```
