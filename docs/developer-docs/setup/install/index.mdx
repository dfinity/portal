# Installing the IC SDK

## Overview

The [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk) is a **software development kit** used for creating and managing canister smart contracts on the ICP blockchain. The IC SDK supports [Motoko](../../backend/choosing-language) and [Rust](../../backend/choosing-language) programming languages by default, but [developers can use other languages as well](../../backend/choosing-language).

## Components of the IC SDK

The IC SDK installation script installs several components in default locations on your local computer. The following table describes the development environment components that the installation script installs:

| Component    | Description                                                                                        | Default location                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| dfx          | Command-line interface (CLI)                                                     | `/usr/local/bin/dfx`                          |
| moc          | Motoko runtime compiler                                                                            | `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/<VERSION>/moc`     |
| replica      | Internet Computer local network binary                                                             | `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/<VERSION>/replica` |
| uninstall.sh | Script to remove the SDK and all of its components                                    | `~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh`               |
| versions     | Cache directory that contains a subdirectory for each version of the SDK you install. | `~/.cache/dfinity/versions`                   |

### IC SDK vs CDK vs `dfx`

There are a few components worth expanding on:

1. **IC SDK**: this is the SDK created by DFINITY for creating and managing canisters. This is just one SDK in the ICP community and a common entry point for developers.

2. **Canister Development Kit (CDK)**: a CDK is an adapter used by the IC SDK that provides a programming language with the features necessary to create and manage canisters. 
The IC SDK comes with a few CDKs already installed for you so you can use them in the language of your choice. For example, the IC SDK comes with the [Rust CDK](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs) already installed. 
CDKs that are not installed but available for developers include the:
  - [Python CDK](https://demergent-labs.github.io/kybra/).
  - [TypeScript CDK](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/). 
  - [C++ CDK](https://docs.icpp.world/).
  
Since CDKs are components used by the SDK, some developers choose to use the CDK directly (without the IC SDK), but typically are used as part of the whole IC SDK.

3. **dfx**: `dfx` is the command-line interface for the IC SDK. This is why many commands for the IC SDK start with the command "`dfx ..`" such as `dfx new` or `dfx stop`.

## Installing the IC SDK

You can download and install the latest version of the [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk) for creating and managing canister smart contracts by running the command below. The following topics provide additional information about installing, upgrading, and removing the IC SDK.

The **IC SDK** is natively supported on Linux or macOS 12.\* Monterey or later. 

There is no native support for <code>dfx</code> on Windows. However, by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can run dfx also on a Windows system as described below.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Install on Mac/Linux" default>
    To install the IC SDK, run

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

:::tip
If you are using a machine running Apple silicon, you will need to have
[Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) installed. You can install Rosetta by running
`softwareupdate --install-rosetta` in your terminal.

    </ul>
    <h2 id="running-linux">Running Linux</h2>
    <p>After you have WSL installed, you can launch the Linux distributions by name.</p>

    <h3 id="node-js-is-not-properly-installed">Node.js is not properly installed</h3>
    <p>WSL 2 has node.js <code>10.x.x</code> installed by default. But the latest <code>dfx</code> requires
      node.js <code>16.0.0</code> or higher.</p>
    <h3 id="permission-denied-when-running-dfx-start-">Permission denied when running <code>dfx start</code></h3>
    <p>Projects created from <code>dfx</code> need to be on the Linux filesystem instead of the Windows filesystem.
      Usually <code>cd ~</code> or <code>cd $HOME</code> in the WSL terminal will bring you to the home directory, and
      creating projects in there should work.</p>
    <h3 id="no-internet-access-on-wsl">No internet access on WSL</h3>
    <p>If you don’t have internet access on WSL, for instance you cannot ping any server successfully, most likely the
      nameserver on WSL is set to an internal WSL proxy. You can check the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to see if
      it’s the case. If it’s true, please follow the below steps to set to a valid nameserver: <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Create the <code>/etc/wsl.conf</code> file and add the below content to it, this will prevent WSL from
          regenerating the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file after restarting.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
      <CodeBlock language="toml">
{`[network]
generateResolvConf = false`}
      </CodeBlock>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 2: Modify the nameserver in the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to a valid one, for example the Google
          nameserver <code>8.8.8.8</code>. </li>
        <li>Step 3: On Windows, restart WSL to let this fix take effect.</li>
        <code>wsl.exe --shutdown</code>
      </ul>

## Core components in a versioned directory

The `~/.cache/dfinity/versions` directory stores one or more versioned subdirectories of the SDK. Each versioned subdirectory contains the all of the directories and files required for a specific version of the SDK. For example, if you list the contents of the `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/0.9.3` directory you would see the following core components:

### Motoko base directory

The `base` directory in the versioned subdirectory of the SDK contains the Motoko base library modules that are compatible with that version of the SDK. Because the Motoko base library is evolving rapidly, you should only use the base modules that are packaged with the version of the SDK that you have installed.

### Bootstrap directory

The `bootstrap` directory contains web server code that is deprecated. Beginning with version 0.7.0, agents can call an HTTP middleware server instead of the `bootstrap` code. This change enables canisters to respond to HTTP requests directly and operate more like traditional web-based applications.

## Upgrading to the latest version

If a new version of the IC SDK is available for download after your initial installation, you should install the updated version at your earliest convenience to get the latest fixes and enhancements as soon as possible. 

You can use the `dfx upgrade` command to compare the version you have currently installed against the latest version available for download. If a newer version of `dfx` is available, the `dfx upgrade` command automatically downloads and installs the latest version.

:::info
You don't need to uninstall the software before installing the new version. However, if you want to perform a clean installation rather than an upgrade, you can first uninstall the software as described in [removing the software](#remove), then re-run the download and installation command.
:::

For information about the features and fixes in the latest release, see the [release notes](/other/updates/release-notes/release-notes.md).

## Installing a specific version

The install script looks for the environment variable `DFX_VERSION` to check if it is supposed to install a specific version of the IC SDK or to simply install the latest version.
If you want to install e.g. version `0.11.1` specifically, you can run the command:

``` bash
DFX_VERSION=0.11.1 sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

### Setting a default version

If defined, the IC SDK will always run the version specified in the project's `dfx.json` in the key `"dfx"`.
For example, if your `dfx.json` contains `"dfx": "0.11.1"`, any `dfx` command you run within this project's directory will be executed by `dfx` of version `0.11.1`.
Should the defined version not be installed (e.g. because you cloned a repo that was created for a different version than you have installed locally), `dfx` will report an error.

To set a **global** default (that gets overwritten by project-specific settings from the project's `dfx.json`), run the install script with the desired version, even if it is already installed.

## Building from source

If you would like to compile dfx by yourself, head over to the [IC SDK repo](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk). The README contains the instructions how you can build it on your own.

## Uninstalling the IC SDK

When you install the IC SDK, the installation script puts the required binary files in a local directory and creates a cache. You can remove the IC SDK binaries and cache from your local computer by running the `uninstall` script located in the `.cache` folder.

For example:

``` bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh
```

If you are uninstalling because you want to immediately reinstall a clean version of `dfx`, you can run the following command:

``` bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```
