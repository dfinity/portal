# Acquiring and managing cycles

## What are ICP cycles?
The Internet Computer blockchain (IC) provides an execution environment for canisters. The Internet Computer consists of hundreds of nodes that are run by Node Providers. Node Providers use infrastructure (CPUs, RAM, and storage) and resources (electricity and network bandwidth) to run the platform. To make the Internet Computer sustainable, developers need to pay for the resources consumed by their canisters.
resource expenditures. Cycles are not currency. You can use ICP tokens to purchase cycles and transfer them to a container called a "cycles wallet."

When a canister needs more cycles, a developer can transfer them from the wallet to the canister. Active canisters deployed to the IC continuously burn cycles and need to be "topped-up" to keep working.

Why are cycles different from ICP tokens? This decision was made to ensure that hosting pricing is not volatile while decreasing the risk that building dapps becomes economically infeasible if the ICP token price increases.

:::note
Cycles are measured in very large numbers, billions and trillions. When you talk about cycle transfers and replenishment, you will usually operate with trillions of cycles.
