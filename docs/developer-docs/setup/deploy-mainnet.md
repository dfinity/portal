# Deploying to the Internet Computer mainnet 

## Overview

This scenario assumes that you are installing the IC SDK for the first time and deploying the default project on the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet.

If you are only deploying projects in a local development environment, see the [local development](./deploy-locally.md) scenario.

To get started, let’s build and deploy a simple 'Hello, world!' dapp that has just one function—called `greet`. The `greet` function accepts one text argument and returns the result with a greeting similar to **Hello, everyone!** in a terminal if you run the dapp using the command-line or in an HTML page if you access the dapp in a browser.

## Prerequisites

Before you download and install this release of the IC SDK, verify the following:

-   [x] You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local computer.

-   [x] You have `node.js` installed if you want to access the default frontend for the default project.

-   [x] You have ICP tokens or cycles available for you to use.

:::info
You must have **cycles** available to complete this guide. To get cycles, you must either convert ICP tokens to cycles or be provided cycles from another source, for example, from a canister controlled by another developer or from a third-party cycles provider. This guide assumes that you have an account with ICP tokens available and illustrates how to convert ICP tokens into cycles, then transfer those cycles to a **cycles wallet** that you control.

For information about how to get ICP tokens, see [how you can get ICP tokens](../setup/cycles/converting_icp_tokens_into_cycles.md).

For an introduction to using the Network Nervous System application to manage ICP tokens, see [Network Nervous System dapp quick start](../../tokenomics/token-holders/nns-app-quickstart).

For information about using your default cycles wallet after you have created it, see [use the default cycles wallet](/developer-docs/setup/cycles/cycles-wallet.md).

## Download and install

You can download the latest version of the IC SDK directly from within a terminal shell on your local computer. If you have previously installed the IC SDK, you can skip this section and start with [create a new project](#net-new-project).

:::caution
These instructions are for **macOS** or **Linux** machines. For Windows instructions, please see [here](/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/index).
:::

To download and install:

- #### Step 1:  Open a terminal shell on your local computer.

    For example, open Applications > Utilities, then double-click **Terminal** or press <span class="keycombo">⌘+spacebar</span> to open Search, then type `terminal`.

- #### Step 2:  Download and install the IC SDK package by running the following command:

        sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"

    This command prompts you to read and accept the license agreement before installing the DFINITY execution command-line interface (CLI) and its dependencies on your local computer.

- #### Step 3:  Type `y` and press Return to continue with the installation.

    The command displays information about the components being installed on the local computer.

## Verify the IC SDK is ready to use

If the installation script runs without any errors, everything you need to start developing programs that run on the IC will be available on your local computer.

To verify the IC SDK is ready to use:

- #### Step 1:  Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.

- #### Step 2:  Check that you have the DFINITY execution command-line interface (CLI) installed and the `dfx` executable is available in your PATH by running the following command:

        dfx --version

    The command displays version information for the `dfx` command-line executable. You can see the latest version in the [release notes](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/releases).

- #### Step 3:  Preview usage information for the other `dfx` command-line sub-commands by running the following command:

        dfx --help

    The command displays usage information for the `dfx` parent command and its subcommands.

## Create a new project

Dapps for the Internet Computer start as **projects**. You create projects using the `dfx` parent command and its subcommands.

For this guide, we’ll start with the default sample dapp to illustrate creating a dapp using the starter files in a project. When you create a new project, the `dfx` command-line interface adds a default project directory structure to your workspace. We cover the template files that make up a project directory in the [explore the default project](/docs/developer-docs/backend/motoko/explore-templates.md) guide.

To create a new project for your first dapp:

- #### Step 1:  Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.

- #### Step 2:  Create a new project named `hello` by running the following command:

        dfx new hello

    The `dfx new hello` command creates a new `hello` project directory, template files, and a new `hello` Git repository for your project.

    If you use a different project name instead of `hello`, make note of the name you used. You’ll need to use that project name in place of the `hello` project name throughout these instructions.

- #### Step 3:  Change to your project directory by running the following command:

        cd hello

## Check the connection to the IC mainnet

There is a reserved network alias that you can use to access the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet. The network alias is a system setting that’s defined internally, so there’s nothing you need to configure in your projects by default.

To check your connection to the IC:

- #### Step 1:  Check that you are in the root directory for your project, if needed.

- #### Step 2:  Check the current status of the IC and your ability to connect to it by running the following command for the network alias `ic`:

        dfx ping ic

- #### Step 3:  Verify that the `dfx ping ic` command returns information about the IC.

    For example, you should see output similar to the following:

        {
          "ic_api_version": "0.18.0"  "impl_hash": "d639545e0f38e075ad240fd4ec45d4eeeb11e1f67a52cdd449cd664d825e7fec"  "impl_version": "8dc1a28b4fb9605558c03121811c9af9701a6142"  "replica_health_status": "healthy"  "root_key": [48, 129, 130, 48, 29, 6, 13, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 97, 0, 129, 76, 14, 110, 199, 31, 171, 88, 59, 8, 189, 129, 55, 60, 37, 92, 60, 55, 27, 46, 132, 134, 60, 152, 164, 241, 224, 139, 116, 35, 93, 20, 251, 93, 156, 12, 213, 70, 217, 104, 95, 145, 58, 12, 11, 44, 197, 52, 21, 131, 191, 75, 67, 146, 228, 103, 219, 150, 214, 91, 155, 180, 203, 113, 113, 18, 248, 71, 46, 13, 90, 77, 20, 80, 95, 253, 116, 132, 176, 18, 145, 9, 28, 95, 135, 185, 136, 131, 70, 63, 152, 9, 26, 11, 170, 174]
        }

## Confirm your developer identity and ledger account

All ICP token transactions are recorded in a [ledger canister](../../references/glossary.md#ledger) running on the Internet Computer blockchain. The ledger canister consists of **account identifiers** and **balances** for all ICP token holders.

Before you can transfer any ICP tokens you hold in your ledger account, you need to send a secure and properly-signed message that verifies your identity to the ledger and authorizes your developer identity to complete the transaction.

Depending on how you have set up custody for holding your ICP tokens, the hardware, software, and steps required to connect to the ledger and complete a transaction can vary. For example, you might connect to the ledger and start a transaction from a hardware wallet, using a hardware security module (HSM) appliance, through the Network Nervous System (NNS) frontend application, or using the IC SDK `dfx` command-line interface. Each approach presents a different interface for signing and sending messages to the ledger and representing your identity as an account holder.

### About your developer identity

The first time you use the IC SDK, the `dfx` command-line tool creates a `default` developer identity for you. This identity is represented by a **principal** data type and a textual representation of the principal often referred to as your **principal identifier**. This representation of your identity is similar to a Bitcoin or Ethereum address.

However, the principal associated with your developer identity is typically not the same as your **account identifier** in the ledger. The principal identifier and the account identifier are related—both provide a textual representation of your identity—but they use different formats.

### Connect to the ledger to get account information

For the purposes of this guide—where there’s no hardware wallet or external application to connect to the ledger—we’ll use your developer identity to retrieve your ledger account identifier, then transfer ICP tokens from the ledger account identifier to a cycles wallet canister controlled by your developer identity.

To look up your account in the ledger:

- #### Step 1:  Confirm the developer identity you are currently using by running the following command:

        dfx identity whoami

    In most cases, you should see that you are currently using default developer identity. For example:

        default

- #### Step 2:  View the textual representation of the principal for your current identity by running the following command:

        dfx identity get-principal

    This command displays output similar to the following:

        tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe

- #### Step 3:  Get the account identifier for your developer identity by running the following command:

        dfx ledger account-id

    This command displays the ledger account identifier associated with your developer identity. For example, you should see output similar to the following:

        03e3d86f29a069c6f2c5c48e01bc084e4ea18ad02b0eec8fccadf4487183c223

- #### Step 4:  Check your account balance by running the following command:

        dfx ledger --network ic balance

    This command displays the ICP token balance from the ledger account. For example, you should see output similar to the following:

        10.00000000 ICP

## Creating a cycles wallet

Now that you have confirmed your account information and current ICP token balance, you can convert some of those ICP tokens to cycles and move them into a cycles wallet.

To transfer ICP tokens to create a cycles wallet:

- #### Step 1:  Create a new canister with cycles by transferring ICP tokens from your ledger account by running a command similar to the following:

        dfx ledger --network ic create-canister <principal-identifier> --amount <icp-tokens>

    This command converts the number of ICP tokens you specify for the `--amount` argument into cycles, and associates the cycles with a new canister identifier controlled by the principal you specify.

    For example, the following command converts .25 ICP tokens into cycles and specifies the principal identifier for the default identity as the controller of the new canister:

        dfx ledger --network ic create-canister tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe --amount .25

    If the transaction is successful, the ledger records the event and you should see output similar to the following:

        Transfer sent at BlockHeight: 20
        Canister created with id: "gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai"

- #### Step 2:  Install the cycles wallet code in the newly-created canister placeholder by running a command similar to the following:

        dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet <canister-identifer>

    For example:

        dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai

    This command displays output similar to the following:

        Creating a wallet canister on the IC network.
        The wallet canister on the "ic" network for user "default" is "gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai"

## Validate your cycles wallet

After you convert ICP tokens to cycles, you can validate the cycles wallet canister and check your current cycles balance.

To validate your cycles wallet:

- #### Step 1: Verify the canister identifier for the cycles wallet you deployed by running the following command:

        dfx identity --network ic get-wallet

    The command displays the canister identifier for your cycles wallet with output similar to the following:

        gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai

- #### Step 2:  Check that your cycles wallet canister is properly configured and holds a balance of cycles by running a command similar to the following:

        dfx wallet --network ic balance

    The command returns the balance for the your cycles wallet. For example:

        15430.122 TC (trillion cycles).

    You can also access your default cycles wallet in a web browser by using a URL similar to the following:

        https://<WALLET-CANISTER-ID>.icp0.io

    The first time you access the application, you see a notice that you are using an 'Anonymous Device' and are prompted to authenticate your identity, authorize access to the wallet, and register your device.

- #### Step 3:  Click **Authenticate** to continue to the Internet Identity service.

- #### Step 4:  Enter your **User Number** if you have previously registered an identity or register with the service as a new user.

    For more information about the Internet Identity service and how to register multiple authentication devices and methods, see [how to use the Internet Identity service](../../references/ii-spec.md).

- #### Step 5:  Authenticate using your user number and the authentication method—for example, a security key or fingerprint—you have registered.

- #### Step 6:  Click **Proceed** to access to the default cycles wallet application.

- #### Step 7:  Register the device you are using for this session by copying the command displayed in the **Register Device** page and running it in a terminal.

    For example, call the `authorize` method for the cycles wallet canister with a command similar to the following:

        dfx canister --network ic call "gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai" authorize '(principal "ejta3-neil3-qek6c-i7rdw-sxreh-lypfe-v6hjg-6so7x-5ugze-3iohr-2qe")'

    Be sure that the command you copy has the correct network (`ic`) alias. You should recognize the canister identifier—in this example, `gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai`—as the cycles wallet associated with your identity. If this is your first wallet on the IC, however, you might not recognize the principal being authorized. The use of a different principal is the expected behavior in this case.

    When the browser refreshes after running the `authorize` command, the cycles wallet for your principal account is displayed.

- #### Step 8:  View your cycles balance and activity in the browser.

    For example:

    ![cycles wallet](_attachments/cycles-wallet.png)

    For more information about the commands and methods available for working with the default cycles wallet, see [use the default cycles wallet](/docs/developer-docs/setup/cycles/cycles-wallet.md).

## Register, build, and deploy the application

After you have validated your cycles wallet balance, you can register, build, and deploy your sample application.

To deploy your first application on the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet:

- #### Step 1:  In your terminal shell, check that you are still in the root directory for your project.

- #### Step 2:  Ensure that `node` modules are available in your project directory, if needed, by running the following command:

        npm install

    For more information about this step, see [ensuring node is available in a project](/developer-docs/frontend/index.md#troubleshoot-node).

- #### Step 3:  Register, build, and deploy your first application by running the following command:

        dfx deploy --network ic

    The `--network` option specifies the network alias or URL for deploying the dapp. This option is required to install on the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet.

    The `dfx deploy` command output displays information about the operations it performs.

    For example, this step registers two identifiers—one for the `hello_backend` main program and one for the `hello_frontend` frontend user interface—and installation information similar to the following:

        Deploying all canisters.
        Creating canisters...
        Creating canister "hello_backend"...
        "hello" canister created on network "ic" with canister id: "5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai"
        Creating canister "hello_frontend"...
        "hello_assets" canister created on network "ic" with canister id: "5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai"
        Building canisters...
        Building frontend...

          /index.html (gzip) 1/1 (314 bytes)
          /index.js 1/1 (260215 bytes)
          /index.js (gzip) 1/1 (87776 bytes)
          /main.css 1/1 (484 bytes)
          /main.css (gzip) 1/1 (263 bytes)
          /sample-asset.txt 1/1 (24 bytes)
          /logo.png 1/1 (25397 bytes)
          /index.js.map 1/1 (842511 bytes)
          /index.js.map (gzip) 1/1 (228404 bytes)
          /index.js.LICENSE.txt 1/1 (499 bytes)
          /index.js.LICENSE.txt (gzip) 1/1 (285 bytes)
        Deployed canisters.

    If you didn’t convert enough ICP tokens to cycles to complete the operation, you can add cycles to your cycles wallet by running a command similar to the following:

        dfx ledger --network ic top-up gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai --amount 1.005

    This command converts an additional `1.005` ICP tokens to cycles for the `gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai` cycles wallet identifier. The command returns output similar to the following:

        Transfer sent at BlockHeight: 81520
        Canister was topped up!

- #### Step 4:  Call the `hello_backend` canister and the predefined `greet` function by running the following command:

        dfx canister --network ic call hello_backend greet '("everyone": text)'

    Let’s take a closer look at this example:

    -   Using the `--network ic` option indicates that the canister you want to call is deployed on the `ic`. The `ic` network alias is an internally-reserved alias for accessing the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet.

    -   Note that the `--network ic` option must precede the operation subcommand, which, in this case, is the `dfx canister call` command.

    -   The `hello_backend` argument specifies the name of the canister you want to call.

    -   The `greet` argument specifies the name of the function you want to call in the `hello` canister.

    -   The text string `everyone` is the argument that you want to pass to the `greet` function.

- #### Step 5:  Verify the command displays the return value of the `greet` function.

    For example:

        ("Hello, everyone!")

- #### Step 6:  Rerun the `dfx wallet balance` command or refresh the browser to see your new cycle balance and recent activity.

## Test the dapp frontend

Now that you have verified that your dapp has been deployed and tested its operation using the command line, let’s verify that you can access the frontend using your web browser.

To access the dapp frontend:

- #### Step 1:  Open a browser.

- #### Step 2:  Navigate to the frontend for the dapp using a URL that consists of the `hello_frontend` identifier and the `boundary.icp0.io` suffix.

    If you didn’t make a note of the canister identifier, you can look it up by running the following command:

        dfx canister --network ic id hello_assets

    For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:

        https://gsueu-yaaaa-aaaae-aaagq-cai.icp0.io

    Navigating to this URL displays the HTML entry page for the template application. For example:

    ![HTML page with prompt](_attachments/net-frontend-prompt.png)

- #### Step 3:  Type a greeting, then click **Click Me** to return the greeting.

## Conclusion

Now that you have seen how to deploy a dapp on the Internet Computer blockchain, you are ready to develop and deploy programs of your own.
