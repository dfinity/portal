# Pulling canister dependencies

## Overview

The interoperability of canisters on the IC is a vital feature for many developers and their workflows. `dfx` provides a consistent developer workflow for creating, integrating and testing third-party canisters with local developer environments. 

Third-party canisters include canisters created by DFINITY, such as NNS, ledger, II, and others, but also include canisters that have been created by developers in the IC community. Developers depend on third-party canisters to integrate with and typically need a way to develop and test the integrations locally for things such as:
- Testing the accuracy of the integration and other canister code.
- Performing tests without paying cycles.
- Performing tests using non-production data and environments.
- Performing tests with faster completion time when run locally. 

To pull these canisters from the IC mainnet to be developed and tested using a local replica, the [`dfx deps`](/docs/references/cli-reference/dfx-deps.md) command and workflow can be used. 

In this workflow, a **service provider** configures a canister to be `pullable`, then deploys the canister to the IC mainnet. A service provider can be DFINITY or it can be a community developer creating a public, third-party canister. 

Then, a **service consumer** can pull the canister as a dependency directly from the mainnet and then deploy the dependency on a local replica. 

In this guide, we'll further describe this workflow and how to use it.

## Determining if a canister should be `pullable`

To pull a canister that's been configured as `pullable`, the service consumer only requires the canister ID. 

Before pulling a canister, first the canister must be configured to be `pullable`. Additionally, we must propose the question of *should* the canister be `pullable`?

#### `Pullable` examples:

If a canister is providing a public service at a static canister ID, then it makes sense for the canister to be `pullable`.

If a service canister also depends on other canisters, those dependencies should also be `pullable`. 

#### Non-`pullable` examples:

If the canister is meant for personal use and not intended for others to use, it does not make sense for the canister to be `pullable`. 

If a canister wasm is published for other developers to use for deploying their own instance, it does not make sense for the canister to be `pullable` since the canister ID of the instance is not static; users can test integrations locally and deploy them directly. An example of this canister type is the asset canister generated by dfx. 

## `Pullable` dfx.json example

For a canister to be `pullable`, the `dfx.json` file must include a `pullable` definition. Below is an example:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "service": {
      "type": "motoko",
      "main": "src/pullable/main.mo",
      "pullable": {
        "dependencies": [],
        "wasm_url": "https://github.com/lwshang/pullable/releases/latest/download/service.wasm",
        "init_guide": "A natural number, e.g. 1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::caution
The wasm module of a `pullable` canister must be hosted via a URL so that service consumers can download it when pulling the dependency.

GitHub Releases are a good, free option if the project is open source on GitHub. The GitHub URL schema is:

`https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPONAME>/releases/latest/download/<FILENAME>`

In a future version of this feature, direct wasm downloads from the replica will likely be supported.
:::

## Service provider workflow overview
First, a service provider must configure a canister to be `pullable` by setting it as such in the `dfx.json` file. 

An example of a provider `dfx.json` which has a `pullable` "service" canister can be found below:

```json
{
    "canisters": {
        "service": {
            "type": "motoko",
            "main": "src/main.mo",
            "pullable": {
                "wasm_url": "http://example.com/a.wasm",
                "wasm_hash": "d180f1e232bafcee7d4879d8a2260ee7bcf9a20c241468d0e9cf4aa15ef8f312",
                "dependencies": [
                    "yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai"
                ],
                "init_guide": "A natural number, e.g. 10."
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `pullable` object will be serialized as a part of the `dfx` metadata and attached to the wasm.

To better understand the `pullable` object, let's look at each property in depth. 

- `wasm_url`: A URL used to download the canister wasm module which will be deployed locally.
- `wasm_hash`: A SHA256 hash of the wasm module located at `wasm_url`. This field is optional. In most cases, the wasm module at `wasm_url` will be the same as the on-chain wasm module. This means that dfx can read the state tree to obtain and verify the module hash. In some cases, the wasm module at `wasm_url` is not the same as the on-chain wasm module. For example, the Internet Identity canister provides a `development` variant to be integrated locally. In these cases, `wasm_hash` provides the expected hash, and `dfx` verifies the downloaded wasm against this.

:::caution
If the `wasm_hash` of the wasm module at `wasm_url` does not match, dfx will abort with an error message indicating there is a hash mismatch. In this scenario, the service consumer should contact the service provider. It is the responsibility of the service provider to assure that the correct wasm module can be downloaded from the `wasm_url`. 
:::

- `dependencies`: An array of Canister IDs (`Principal`) of direct dependencies.
- `init_guide`: A message to guide consumers how to initialize the canister.

### Canister metadata requirements

A service provider canister used in production or in a production environment running on the mainnet should have public `dfx` metadata.

The canister wasm downloaded from `wasm_url` should have the following metadata (public or private):

- `candid:service`
- `candid:args`
- `dfx`

All metadata sections are handled by `dfx` when the canister is built.

### Deployment process
Service providers will use the following deployment process to deploy their `pullable` canister.

- #### Step 1: Deploy the canister to the mainnet with the command:

```
dfx deploy --network ic
```

- #### Step 2: If you're using GitHub, `git tag` and `GitHub release` with the commands:

```
git tag 0.1.0
git push --tags
```

You can follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release) to create a release.

- #### Step 3: Attach the wasm to the release assets. 
Edit the release and attach the deployed wasm as a release asset.

The deployed wasm file will be located at:

```
.dfx/ic/canisters/<CANISTER_NAME>/<CANISTER_NAME>.wasm
```

### Automating the service provider process in CI

An [example CI configuration](https://github.com/lwshang/pullable/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) demonstrates how to use a GitHub Action to automate the deploy routine described above.

The workflow with CI will follow these steps:

1. Push a git tag and wait for the GitHub release to complete.
2. Download the canister wasm from the release assets (`wget https://github.com/lwshang/pullable/releases/latest/download/service.wasm`).
3. Install (upgrade) the canister using the downloaded wasm (`dfx canister --network ic install service --wasm service.wasm --argument '(1 : nat)' --mode upgrade`).

## Service consumer workflow overview

The following workflow can be used for service consumers to pull a `pullable` canister as a dependency. 

### Step 1: Declare "pull" dependencies in `dfx.json`.

First, to pull the dependencies from the mainnet, the `dfx.json` file must include the `dependencies` configuration for the canister. 

An example `dfx.json` in which the service consumer is developing a canister named "dapp", which has two pull dependencies, can be found below:

- "dep_b" has canister ID of `yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai` on the mainnet.
- "dep_c" has canister ID of `yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai` on the mainnet.

```json
{
    "canisters": {
        "dapp": {
            "type": "motoko",
            "main": "src/main.mo",
            "dependencies": [
                "dep_b", "dep_c"
            ]
        },
        "dep_b": {
            "type": "pull",
            "id": "yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai"
        },
        "dep_c": {
            "type": "pull",
            "id": "yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai"
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Pull the dependencies using the `dfx deps pull` command.

Running the command `dfx deps pull` will do the following:

1. First, it will resolve the dependency graph by fetching the `dependencies` field in the `dfx` metadata recursively.
2. Then, it will download the wasm of all direct and indirect dependencies from `wasm_url` into the shared cache.
3. Next, the hash of the downloaded wasm will be verified against `wasm_hash` metadata or the hash of the canister deployed on mainnet. 
4. Then, `candid:args`, `candid:service`, `dfx` metadata will be extracted from the downloaded wasm.
5. The `deps/` folder is created in the project root.
6. The `candid:service` of direct dependencies is saved as `deps/candid/<CANISTER_ID>.did`.
7. The `deps/pulled.json` which contains major info of all direct and indirect dependencies is saved.

For the example project, you will find following files in `deps/`:

- `yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai.did` and `yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai.did`: Candid files that can be imported by "dapp".
- `pulled.json`: A json file with the following content:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai": {
      "dependencies": [],
      "wasm_hash": "e9b8ba2ad28fa1403cf6e776db531cdd6009a8e5cac2b1097d09bfc65163d56f",
      "init_guide": "A natural number, e.g. 10.",
      "candid_args": "(nat)"
    },
    "yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai": {
      "name": "dep_b",
      "dependencies": [
        "yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai"
      ],
      "wasm_hash": "f607c30727b0ee81317fc4547a8da3cda9bb9621f5d0740806ef973af5b479a2",
      "init_guide": "No init arguments required",
      "candid_args": "()"
    },
    "yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai": {
      "name": "dep_c",
      "dependencies": [
        "yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai"
      ],
      "wasm_hash": "016df9800dc5760785646373bcb6e6bb530fc17f844600991a098ef4d486cf0b",
      "init_guide": "A natural number, e.g. 20.",
      "candid_args": "(nat)"
    }
  }
}
```

In this file, you can see there are three dependencies:

- `yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai`: "dep_b" in `dfx.json`.
- `yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai`: "dep_c" in `dfx.json`.
- `yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai`: an indirect dependency that both "dep_b" and "dep_c" depend on.

:::caution
`dfx deps pull` connects to the IC mainnet by default (`--network ic`). You can choose other network as usual, e.g. `--network local`.
:::

### Step 3: Set init arguments using `dfx deps init`

Running the command `dfx deps init` will iterate over all dependencies in the `pulled.json` file and set an empty argument for any that do not need an `init` argument. Then, it will print the list of dependencies that do require an `init` argument.

Running the command `dfx deps init <CANISTER> --argument <ARGUMENT>` will set the `init` argument for an individual dependency. The init arguments will be recorded in `deps/init.json`.

Using the example above, we can run the following commands:

- To set the init arguments:

```
dfx deps init
WARN: The following canister(s) require an init argument. Please run `dfx deps init <NAME/PRINCIPAL>` to set them individually:
yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai
yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai (dep_c)
```

- If you try to set an `init` argument for an individual dependency without an argument, it will result in the following error:

```
dfx deps init yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai
Error: Canister yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai requires an init argument. The following info might be helpful:
init_guide => A natural number, e.g. 10.
candid:args => (nat)
```

```
dfx deps init deps_c
Error: Canister yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai (dep_c) requires an init argument. The following info might be helpful:
init_guide => A natural number, e.g. 20.
candid:args => (nat)
```

- To set an init argument with an argument using the `--argument` flag, the following commands can be used:

```
dfx deps init yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai --argument 10
dfx deps init deps_c --argument 20
```

The resulting generated file `init.json` will have the following content:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai": {
      "arg_str": "10",
      "arg_raw": "4449444c00017d0a"
    },
    "yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai": {
      "arg_str": null,
      "arg_raw": null
    },
    "yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai": {
      "arg_str": "20",
      "arg_raw": "4449444c00017d14"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Deploy the pulled dependencies on a local replica using the `dfx deps deploy` command.

Running the `dfx deps deploy` command will:

1. First, create the dependencies on the local replica with the same mainnet canister ID.
2. Then, it will install the downloaded wasm with the init arguments in the `init.json` file.

You can also specify the name or principal to deploy one particular dependency.

Using the example above, we can run the following command to deploy all dependencies:

```
dfx deps deploy
Creating canister: yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai
Installing canister: yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai
Creating canister: yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai (dep_b)
Installing canister: yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai (dep_b)
Creating canister: yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai (dep_c)
Installing canister: yahli-baaaa-aaaaa-aabtq-cai (dep_c)
```

To deploy one particular dependency, the following command can be used: 

```
dfx deps deploy yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai
Installing canister: yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai
```

```
dfx deps deploy dep_b
Installing canister: yhgn4-myaaa-aaaaa-aabta-cai (dep_b)
```

:::info
`dfx deps deploy` always creates the canister with the anonymous identity so that dependencies and application canisters will have different controllers. It also will always install the canister in "reinstall" mode so that the canister status will be discarded.
:::

## Interactive example

Now that we've explored the concepts and overview of using the `dfx deps` workflow, let's take a look at using an interactive example to demonstrate the functionality. 

This example project will demonstrate an application canister pulling its dependency from the IC mainnet and integrating with it locally. 

In this example, the `app` canister defines a method called `double_service` which makes an inter-canister call to the `service` canister.

- #### Step 1: First, assure that you have installed the [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk).

- #### Step 2: Then, open a terminal window and create a new dfx project with the command:

```
dfx new pull_deps_example
```

- #### Step 3: Then, open the project's `dfx.json` file in a text or code editor. Declare the pull dependency with the following configuration:

```
{
  "canisters": {
    "service": {
      "type": "pull",
      "id": "ig5e5-aqaaa-aaaan-qdxya-cai"
    }
  },
}
```

Save the file.

- #### Step 4: Use `dfx deps pull` to pull from the mainnet:

```
dfx deps pull
Fetching dependencies of canister ig5e5-aqaaa-aaaan-qdxya-cai...
Found 1 dependencies:
ig5e5-aqaaa-aaaan-qdxya-cai
Pulling canister ig5e5-aqaaa-aaaan-qdxya-cai...
```

- #### Step 5: Configure the `init` argument:

```
dfx deps init service --argument 1
```

- #### Step 6: Deploy on a local replica with the commands:

```
dfx start --clean --background
dfx deps deploy
dfx deploy app
```

- #### Step 7: Test the app by making the following call:
  
```
dfx canister call app double_service
```

In this step, the `app` canister's `double_service` method is being called, which sends an inter-canister call to the `service` canister. The call will succeed since both canisters are now deployed on the local replica.

The output will resemble the following:

```
(2 : nat)
```

## Frequently asked questions

- #### Why download wasm into shared cache instead of a project subfolder?

We don't want to encourage including binary files in version control. On the Internet Computer, every canister only has one latest version running on mainnet. Service consumers should integrate with that latest version. 

`dfx deps pull` always gets the latest dependencies instead of locking on a particular run. Every pulled canister has the latest version in the shared cache and can be reused by different projects.

- #### Should I include `deps/` folder in version control?

Yes. `deps/` files enable the dependent canister to build and get IDE support. If the required wasm files are also available in the shared cache, all application and dependencies can be deployed and tested integrally.

Considering a canister developer team:

1.  Developer 1 follows the [service consumer workflow](#service-consumer-workflow) and includes all generated `deps/` files in source control.
2.  Developer 2 pulls the branch by Developer 1 and runs the `dfx deps pull` command again.
    - If the `pulled.json` has no change, then all dependencies are still up to date. Developer 2 can run `dfx deps deploy` without setting init arguments again.
    - If there are changes in `pulled.json`, Developer 2 can try to run `dfx deps deploy` to see if all init arguments are still valid. Then Developer 2 can run `dfx deps init` if necessary and update source control.

These files also help CI to detect outdated dependencies.
