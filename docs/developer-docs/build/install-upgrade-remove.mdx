# Installing the SDK

You can download and install the latest version of the DFINITY Canister smart contract SDK, called `dfx`, by running the command below. The topics here provide additional information about installing, upgrading, and removing the SDK.

`dfx` is natively supported on Linux or macOS 12.\* Monterey or later.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="apple" label="Install on Mac/Linux" default> 
To install <code>dfx</code>, run

```bash
    sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Install on Windows">
<p>There is no native support for <code>dfx</code> on Windows. However, by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can run <code>dfx</code> also on a Windows system as described below.</p>
<h2 id="installing-wsl">Installing WSL 2</h2>
<p>Follow Microsoft&#39;s instructions for installing the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>. Make sure you are running Windows 10 (version 2004 or higher) or Windows 11.</p>
<h3 id="supported-wsl-versions">Supported WSL Versions</h3>
<p>Theoretically, WSL 1 and WSL 2 should both allow you to run <code>dfx</code>. However, we recommend WSL 2. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions">WSL Comparison</a> explains the differences between WSL1 and WSL 2.</p>
<h3 id="check-your-wsl-version">Check your WSL version</h3>
<p>Run the command <code>wsl –list –verbose (wsl -l -v)</code> to check the Linux distributions installed on your Windows machine. Below is an example output.</p>

```
    NAME        STATE      VERSION
    * Ubuntu    Running     2
```

<p>To learn more about the <code>wsl</code> command, check the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands">command reference for WSL</a>.</p>
<h3 id="upgrade-to-wsl-2">Upgrade from WSL 1</h3>
<p>If you have WSL 1 installed, follow the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2">upgrade instructions</a> to upgrade to WSL 2. Basically you need to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package">WSL 2 Linux kernel update package</a>.</li>
<li>Run the following command to set your Linux distributions to version 2. <code>wsl --set-version &lt;distribution name&gt; 2</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="running-linux">Running Linux</h2>
<p>After you have WSL installed, you can launch the Linux distributions by name.</p>
<p>For example <code>Ubuntu.exe</code> is the command to start the <code>Ubuntu</code> distribution from the command line.</p>
<h2 id="installing-dfx">Installing DFX</h2>
<p>Once you have WSL installed, you can install <code>dfx</code> by running

```bash
    sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="node-js-is-not-properly-installed">Node.js is not properly installed</h3>
<p>WSL 2 has node.js <code>10.x.x</code> installed by default. But the latest <code>dfx</code> requires node.js <code>16.0.0</code> or higher.</p>
<h3 id="permission-denied-when-running-dfx-start-">Permission Denied when running <code>dfx start</code></h3>
<p>Projects created from <code>dfx</code> need to be on the Linux filesystem instead of the Windows filesystem. Usually <code>cd ~</code> or <code>cd $HOME</code> in the WSL terminal will bring you to the home directory, and creating projects in there should work.</p>
<h3 id="no-internet-access-on-wsl">No internet access on WSL</h3>
<p>If you don’t have internet access on WSL, for instance you cannot ping any server successfully, most likely the nameserver on WSL is set to an internal WSL proxy. You can check the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to see if it’s the case. If it’s true, please follow the below steps to set to a valid nameserver: <br/ >
<ul>
<li>Create the <code>/etc/wsl.conf</code> file and add the below content to it, this will prevent WSL from regenerating the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file after restarting. </li>

```
[network]
generateResolvConf = false
```

<li>Modify the nameserver in the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to a valid one, for example the Google nameserver <code>8.8.8.8</code>. </li>
<li>On Windows, restart WSL to let this fix take effect. </li>
<code>wsl.exe --shutdown</code>
</ul>

## What gets installed

The SDK installation script installs several components in default locations on your local computer. The following table describes the development environment components that the installation script installs:

| Component    | Description                                                                                        | Default location                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| dfx          | DFINITY execution command-line interface (CLI)                                                     | `/usr/local/bin/dfx`                          |
| moc          | Motoko runtime compiler                                                                            | `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/<VERSION>/moc`     |
| replica      | Internet Computer local network binary                                                             | `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/<VERSION>/replica` |
| uninstall.sh | Script to remove the SDK and all of its components                                    | `~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh`               |
| versions     | Cache directory that contains a subdirectory for each version of the SDK you install. | `~/.cache/dfinity/versions`                   |

### Core components in a versioned directory

The `~/.cache/dfinity/versions` directory stores one or more versioned subdirectories of the SDK. Each versioned subdirectory contains the all of the directories and files required for a specific version of the SDK. For example, if you list the contents of the `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/0.9.3` directory you would see the following core components:

### Motoko base directory

The `base` directory in the versioned subdirectory of the SDK contains the Motoko base library modules that are compatible with that version of the SDK. Because the Motoko base library is evolving rapidly, you should only use the base modules that are packaged with the version of the SDK that you have installed.

### Bootstrap directory

The `bootstrap` directory contains web server code that is deprecated. Beginning with version 0.7.0, agents can call an HTTP middleware server instead of the `bootstrap` code. This change enables canisters to respond to HTTP requests directly and operate more like traditional web-based applications.

## Upgrading to the latest version

If a new version of the SDK is available for download after your initial installation, you should install the updated version at your earliest convenience to get the latest fixes and enhancements as soon as possible. You can use the `dfx upgrade` command to compare the version you have currently installed against the latest version available for download. If a newer version of `dfx` is available, the `dfx upgrade` command automatically downloads and installs the latest version.

Note that you don't need to uninstall the software before installing the new version. However, if you want to perform a clean installation rather than an upgrade, you can first uninstall the software as described in [Removing the software](#remove), then re-run the download and installation command.

For information about the features and fixes in the latest release, see the [Release notes](../updates/release-notes/sdk-release-notes.md).

## Installing a specific version

The install script looks for the environment variable `DFX_VERSION` to check if it is supposed to install a specific version of the SDK or to simply install the latest version.
If you want to install e.g. version `0.11.1` specifically, you would run this:

``` bash
DFX_VERSION=0.11.1 sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

### Setting a default version

If defined, `dfx` will always run the version specified in the project's `dfx.json` in the key `"dfx"`.
For example, if your `dfx.json` contains `"dfx": "0.11.1"`, any `dfx` command you run within this project's directory will be executed by `dfx` of version `0.11.1`.
Should the defined version not be installed (e.g. because you cloned a repo that was created for a different version than you have installed locally), `dfx` will report an error.

To set a _global_ default (that gets overwritten by project-specific settings from the project's `dfx.json`), run the install script with the desired version, even if it is already installed.

## Removing the software

When you install the SDK, the installation script puts the required binary files in a local directory and creates a cache. You can remove the SDK binaries and cache from your local computer by running the `uninstall` script located in the `.cache` folder.

For example:

``` bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh
```

If you are uninstalling because you want to immediately reinstall a clean version of `dfx`, you can run the following command:

``` bash
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```
