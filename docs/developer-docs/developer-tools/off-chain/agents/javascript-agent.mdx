# JavaScript agent

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Agents", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

An agent is a low-level interface used by a canister's actor to encode and decode messages sent to the ICP mainnet. The JavaScript agent (`agent-js`) is used to interact with the public ICP API endpoints and canisters deployed on ICP. `agent-js` provides `call`, `query`, and `readState` methods, along with other utilities, to an actor.

Calls made through the agent are intended to be structured through an actor and configured with a canister's interface that can be generated from a [Candid interface](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/candid/candid-concepts). Raw calls are supported, but not recommended per best practices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
To get started with `agent-js`, it is recommended your development environment includes:

- [x] IC SDK for canister creation and management.
- [x] Node JS (12, 14, or 16).
- [x] A canister you want to experiment with.
  - Suggestions:
    - `dfx new` default project.
    - An example from [dfinity/examples](https://github.com/dfinity/examples).

To install the JavaScript agent, run the following command:

```
npm i --save @dfinity/agent
```

## Authentication

`agent-js` supports authentication through `auth-client`, which uses the [Internet Identity service](/docs/current/developer-docs/identity/internet-identity/overview).

First, install the `auth-client` package:

```
npm i --save @dfinity/auth-client
```

Create an authentication client that will open an `identity.ic0.app` window, save your delegation to `localStorage`, and provide you with an identity:

```
const authClient = await AuthClient.create();
The authClient can log in with

authClient.login({
  // 7 days in nanoseconds
  maxTimeToLive: BigInt(7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000),
  onSuccess: async () => {
    handleAuthenticated(authClient);
  },
});
```

Then, use that identity to make authenticated calls using the `@dfinity/agent` actor:

```
const identity = await authClient.getIdentity();
const actor = Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
  agent: new HttpAgent({
    identity,
  }),
  canisterId,
});
```

### Storage and key management

By default, `agent-js` uses a default IndexedDb storage interface and ECDSA keys.

You can use an any storage structure that implements the AuthClientStorage interface:

```
export type StoredKey = string | CryptoKeyPair;
export interface AuthClientStorage {
  get(key: string): Promise<StoredKey | null>;

  set(key: string, value: StoredKey): Promise<void>;

  remove(key: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

:::caution

If you decide to use a custom storage implementation that only supports string data types, it is recommended to use the `keyType` option to use an `Ed25519` key instead of the default ECDSA key:

```
const authClient = await AuthClient.create({
  storage: new LocalStorage(),
  keyType: 'Ed25519',
});
```
:::

### Session management

There are two options supported by the AuthClient for secure session management:

1. The `maxTimeToLive` option built into the Internet Identity delegation determines in nanoseconds how long the `DelegationIdentity` returned will be valid for.

2. The Idle Manager, which monitors keyboard, mouse and touchscreen identity. The Idle Manager will automatically log you out if the browser is not interacted with for a period of time.

    - By default, this period is 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the `DelegationIdentity` will be removed from from localStorage and `window.location.reload()` is called.

    - Alternatively, you can pass an `onIdle` option, that will replace the default `window.location.reload()` behavior, or register callbacks with `idleManager.registerCallback()`, which will also replace the default callback.

View the full set of [options for the IdleManager](https://agent-js.icp.xyz/auth-client/index.html).

## Initializing an actor

Agents are most commonly used to create an actor using the `Actor.createActor` constructor:

```
Actor.createActor(interfaceFactory: InterfaceFactory, configuration: ActorConfig): ActorSubclass<T>
```

The `interfaceFactory` function returns a runtime interface that the actor uses to structure calls made to a canister. This function is generated by running the `dfx generate` command in your project or using the `didc` tool to generate interfaces for your project. Alternatively, this function can be written manually, though it is not recommended.

To set up an actor, you can import a `createActor` utility from your canister's Candid declarations, and `canisterId alias`, which by default points to `process.env<canister-id>_CANISTER_ID`.

You can pass the canister ID environment variable logic to your application in a number of ways, such as:

- Edit it into the start of your `package.json` scripts (`NFT_CANISTER_ID=... node....`).

- Install [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and configure it to read from a hidden `.env` file.

The following example uses local development, where you can read the canister ID from the local `canister_ids.json` file which can be found at `.dfx/local/canister_ids.json`:

```js
// src/node/index.js
import fetch from "isomorphic-fetch";
import { HttpAgent } from "@dfinity/agent";
import { createRequire } from "node:module";
import { canisterId, createActor } from "../declarations/agent_js_example/index.js";
import { identity } from "./identity.js";

// Require syntax is needed for JSON file imports
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);
const localCanisterIds = require("../../.dfx/local/canister_ids.json");

// Use `process.env` if available provided, or fall back to local
const effectiveCanisterId =
  canisterId?.toString() ?? localCanisterIds.agent_js_example.local;

const agent = new HttpAgent({
  identity: await identity,
  host: "http://127.0.0.1:4943",
  fetch,
});

const actor = createActor(effectiveCanisterId, {
  agent,
});
```

### HTTP headers

An actor can be initialized to include the boundary node HTTP headers using the `Actor.createActor` constructor:

```
Actor.createActorWithHttpDetails(interfaceFactory: InterfaceFactory, configuration: ActorConfig): ActorSubclass<ActorMethodMappedWithHttpDetails<T>>
```


### Inspecting an actor's agent

To get the agent of an actor, use the `Actor.agentOf` method:

```
const defaultAgent = Actor.agentOf(defaultActor);
```

This method can be used to replace or invalidate an identity used by an actor's agent. For example, the following method can be used to replace the current identity of an actor's agent with a newly authenticated identity from Internet Identity:

```
defaultAgent.replaceIdentity(await authClient.getIdentity());
```

## Making calls

`agent-js` supports the following methods for making calls to ICP:

- `call`: Used to make [update calls](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/call/overview/#update-calls).

- `query`: Used to make [query calls](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/call/overview/#query-calls).

- `readState`: Used to read state information from the ICP replica.

:::info
Raw calls can be made using the agent, but it is recommended to use the agent's generated calls instead.
:::

### Update calls

Update calls on ICP make a change to the canister's state. To make an update call with `agent-js`, use the `call` method:

```
call(canisterId: string | Principal, fields: CallOptions): Promise<SubmitResponse>
```

This method is defined in [packages/agent/src/agent/api.ts:178](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/blob/21e8d2b/packages/agent/src/agent/api.ts#L178).

Parameters for this method are:

- `canisterId`: The canister's principal ID in the format `string`.

- `fields`: The call's options. Possible options are defined in [CallOptions](https://agent-js.icp.xyz/agent/interfaces/CallOptions.html).

The `call` method returns `Promise<[SubmitResponse](https://agent-js.icp.xyz/agent/interfaces/SubmitResponse.html)>`.


### Query calls

Query calls on ICP do not change a canister's state and only used to return information. To make an update call with `agent-js`, use the `query` method:

```
query(canisterId: string | Principal, options: QueryFields, identity?: Identity | Promise<Identity>): Promise<ApiQueryResponse>
```

This method is defined in [packages/agent/src/agent/api.ts:200](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/blob/21e8d2b/packages/agent/src/agent/api.ts#L200)

Parameters for this method are:

- `canisterId`: The canister's principal ID in the format `string`. Note that sending a query to the [management canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/management-canister) is not supported, as it has no meaning from an agent.

- `options`: Options used to create and send the query. Possible options are defined in [QueryFields](https://agent-js.icp.xyz/agent/interfaces/QueryFields.html).

- `identity`: Optional; identifies the sender principal to use when sending the query.

The `query` method returns `Promise<ApiQueryResponse>`. This is the response from the replica, and will reject if the communication failed. If the query itself failed but there were no protocol errors, the response will be of type `QueryResponseRejected`.

### Read state information

To read state information from the ICP replica, use the `readState` method. This method makes a query call with a list of paths to return, and receives a certificate in response. If there are communication errors, the call will be rejected, and the certificate may contain less information than what was requested.

```
readState(effectiveCanisterId: string | Principal, options: ReadStateOptions, identity?: Identity, request?: any): Promise<ReadStateResponse>
```

This method is defined in [packages/agent/src/agent/api.ts:170](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/blob/21e8d2b/packages/agent/src/agent/api.ts#L170)

Parameters for this method are:

- `effectiveCanisterId`: A canister's principal ID related to the call in the format `string`.

- `options`: The call's options. Possible options are defined in [ReadStateOptions](https://agent-js.icp.xyz/agent/interfaces/ReadStateOptions.html).

- `identity`: Optional; identifies the sender principal to use when sending the query. If not specified, uses the instance identity.

- `request`: Optional, The request to send in case it has already been created.

This method returns `Promise<ReadStateResponse>`.

## Structuring data


## Decoding data


## Browser

When you are building apps that run in the browser, you can use the `fetch` API as described below. Most apps will be able to determine whether they need to talk to `https://icp0.io` or a local replica, depending on their URL.

### Using `fetch`

`agent-js` uses the web browser's `fetch` API to make calls to ICP. When the agent isn't used in the browser, a `fetch` implementation can be passed to the agent's constructor. This can be useful if you want to include custom `fetch` implementation data, such as adding an authentication header to your request.

It is recommended to use the `isomorphic-fetch` package to provide a consistent `fetch` API across Node.js and the browser. You will need to provide a host option to the agent's constructor, since the agent will not be able to determine the host from the global context.

An example can be found below:

```
import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch';
import { HttpAgent } from '@dfinity/agent';

const host = process.env.DFX_NETWORK === 'local' ? 'http://127.0.0.1:4943' : 'https://icp-api.io';

const agent = new HttpAgent({ fetch, host });
```

You can also pass `fetchOptions` to the agent's constructor, which is then passed to the `fetch` implementation. This is useful if you want to pass additional options to the fetch implementation. An example specifying a custom header can be found below:

```
import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch';
import { HttpAgent } from '@dfinity/agent';

const host = process.env.DFX_NETWORK === 'local' ? 'http://127.0.0.1:4943' : 'https://ic0.app';

/**
 * @type {RequestInit}
 */
const fetchOptions = {
  headers: {
    'X-Custom-Header': 'value',
  },
};

const agent = new HttpAgent({ fetch, host, fetchOptions });
```

## Performance

When developing an app that runs in browser, it is important to take application performance into consideration. Updates to ICP may feel slow to your users, at around 2-4 seconds. When building your application, take that latency into consideration and consider following these best practices:

- Avoid blocking UI interactions while you wait for the result of your update. Instead, allow users to continuing to make other updates and interactions, and inform your users of success asynchronously.

- Try to avoid making inter-canister calls. If the backend needs to talk to other canisters, the latency can add up quickly.

- Use `Promise.all` to make multiple calls in a batch, instead of making them one by one.

- If you need to fetch assets or data, you can make direct `fetch` calls to the `raw.icp0.io` endpoint of canisters.

## Bundlers

It is recommended to use a bundler to assemble your code for convenience and simplified troubleshooting. Below is an example that provides a standard Webpack configuration, but you may also use other frameworks such as Rollup, Vite, Parcel, or others.

For this pattern, it is recommended to run a script to generate the `.env.development` and `.env.production` environment variable files for your project's canister IDs. This is a fairly standard approach for bundlers, and can be easily supported using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv). An example of this script can be found below:

```js
// setupEnv.js
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

function initCanisterEnv() {
  let localCanisters, prodCanisters;
  try {
    localCanisters = require(path.resolve(
      ".dfx",
      "local",
      "canister_ids.json"
    ));
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("No local canister_ids.json found");
  }
  try {
    prodCanisters = require(path.resolve("canister_ids.json"));
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("No production canister_ids.json found");
  }

  const network =
    process.env.DFX_NETWORK ||
    (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "ic" : "local");

  const canisterConfig = network === "local" ? localCanisters : prodCanisters;

  const localMap = localCanisters
    ? Object.entries(localCanisters).reduce((prev, current) => {
        const [canisterName, canisterDetails] = current;
        prev[canisterName.toUpperCase() + "_CANISTER_ID"] =
          canisterDetails[network];
        return prev;
      }, {})
    : undefined;
  const prodMap = prodCanisters
    ? Object.entries(prodCanisters).reduce((prev, current) => {
        const [canisterName, canisterDetails] = current;
        prev[canisterName.toUpperCase() + "_CANISTER_ID"] =
          canisterDetails[network];
        return prev;
      }, {})
    : undefined;
  return [localMap, prodMap];
}
const [localCanisters, prodCanisters] = initCanisterEnv();

if (localCanisters) {
  const localTemplate = Object.entries(localCanisters).reduce((start, next) => {
    const [key, val] = next;
    if (!start) return `${key}=${val}`;
    return `${start ?? ""}
          ${key}=${val}`;
  }, ``);
  fs.writeFileSync(".env.development", localTemplate);
}
if (prodCanisters) {
  const prodTemplate = Object.entries(prodCanisters).reduce((start, next) => {
    const [key, val] = next;
    if (!start) return `${key}=${val}`;
    return `${start ?? ""}
        ${key}=${val}`;
  }, ``);
  fs.writeFileSync(".env", localTemplate);
}
```

Then, you can add `"prestart"` and `"prebuild"` commands of `dfx generate; node setupEnv.js`. Follow documentation for your preferred bundler on how to work with environment variables.
