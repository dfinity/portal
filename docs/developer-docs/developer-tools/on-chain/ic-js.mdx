## Overview

`ic-js` is a collection of JavaScript libraries that can be used to interface with ICP. Each library can be used independently from one another, or a project can use all of the libraries together. The NNS dapp is an example demonstration of all `ic-js` libraries being used together.


## Dependencies

`ic-js` uses `@dfinity/agent` (ICP JavaScript agent) and `@dfinity/utils` as peer dependencies. It is recommended to have these packages available in your project as well.

You can install them using `npm`:

```
npm i @dfinity/agent @dfinity/candid @dfinity/principal @dfinity/utils
```
