# dfx v0.17.0 CI migration guide

## Overview

`dfxvm` is a new tool used for installing and managing different versions of `dfx`. In `dfx` versions 0.17.0 and newer, `dfxvm` is used to install and update `dfx`. This means CI jobs that install `dfx` will need to update their workflow.

## GitHub actions

If your CI job uses GitHub actions, you can edit your `dfx` install job to use the following configuration:

```
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install dfx
      uses: dfinity/setup-dfx@main
    - name: Confirm successful installation
      run: dfx --version
```

## Manual CI job

If you use a manual CI job, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Set `DFXVM_INIT_YES=true` so that the installer bypasses prompts:

```
DFXVM_INIT_YES=true sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
```

2. Add the path for `dfxvm bin` to your PATH variable:

```
# Linux:
"$HOME/.local/share/dfx/bin"

# Macos:
"$HOME/Library/Application Support/org.dfinity.dfx/bin"
```

3. Depending on the setup of your CI script, you may need to source the `dfx/env` script as well:

```
# Linux:
source "$HOME/.local/share/dfx/env"

# Macos:
source "$HOME/Library/Application Support/org.dfinity.dfx/env"
```

## Docker

For CI jobs that use Docker environments, the following Dockerfile configuration can be used:

```
ARG DFX_VERSION
RUN DFXVM_INIT_YES=true sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
RUN . $HOME/.local/share/dfx/env
ENV PATH="/root/.local/share/dfx/bin:$PATH"
```
