# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

When building an application that enables users to have profiles or buy and sell assets, you must implement an authentication method. An authentication method allows users to log into an application by providing some form of credential or verification of identity. Authentication methods vary in levels of security and data privacy.

## Authentication methods

Authentication methods available on ICP include:

- [Internet Identity](./internet-identity/overview): ICP's native identity service that uses a cryptographic public/private key pair for authentication.

- [Email and password](email-password.mdx): Authentication with an email and password.

- [NFID](nfid.mdx): A digital form of identity that allows users to use an email and password or their Google account.

- [Sign in with Ethereum](siwe.mdx): An authentication standard that enables Ethereum wallet-based authentication for ICP applications.

- [`ic-auth`](https://github.com/id-daniel-mccoy/ic-auth): A modular tool to integrate wallet providers into ICP apps. Supports Stoic, Plug, Internet Identity, and NFID.

- [Plug wallet](https://docs.plugwallet.ooo/getting-started/extension-components/): An in-browser wallet for managing all ICP assets such as cycles, ICP, tokens, and NFTs.
