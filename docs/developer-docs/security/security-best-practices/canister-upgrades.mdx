# Security best practices: Canister upgrades

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Security", "Concept"]} />

## Be careful with panics during upgrades

### Security concern

If a canister traps or panics in `pre_upgrade`, this can lead to permanently blocking the canister, resulting in a situation where upgrades fail or are no longer possible at all.

### Recommendation

- Avoid using `pre_upgrade` hooks if possible. Panics in the `pre_upgrade` hook prevent upgrade, and since the `pre_upgrade` hook is controlled by the old code, it can permanently block upgrading.

- Panic in the `post_upgrade` hook if state is invalid, so that one can retry the upgrade and try to fix the invalid state. Panics in the the `post_upgrade` hook abort the upgrade, but one can retry with new code.

- [Test the upgrade hooks](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#test-upgrades) (from [effective Rust canisters](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html)).

- See also the section on upgrades in [how to audit an Internet Computer canister](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/788-How_to_audit_an_Internet_Computer_canister) (though focused on Motoko).

## Reinstantiate timers during upgrades

### Security concern

Global timers are deactivated upon changes to the canister's Wasm module. The [IC specification](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#global-timer) states this as follows:

> "The timer is also deactivated upon changes to the canister's Wasm module (calling install_code, uninstall_code methods of the management canister or if the canister runs out of cycles). In particular, the function canister_global_timer won't be scheduled again unless the canister sets the global timer again (using the System API function ic0.global_timer_set)."

Upgrade is a mode of `install_code` and hence the timers are deactivated during an upgrade.

This could result in a vulnerability in certain cases where security controls or other critical features rely on these timers to function. For example, a DEX which relies on timers to update the exchange rates of currencies could be vulnerable to arbitraging opportunities if the rates are no longer updated.

Since global timers are used internally by the Motoko `Timer` mechanism, the same holds true for Motoko Timer. As explained in the [pull request](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/pull/3542) under "The upgrade story", the global timer gets discarded on upgrade, and the timers need to be set up in the `post_upgrade` hook.

This behavior is different when [using Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/pull/3542) and implementing `system func timer`. The `timer` function will be called after an upgrade. In case your canister was using timers for recurring tasks, the `timer` function would likely set the global timer again for a later time. However, the time between invocations of `timer` would not be consistent as the upgrade triggered an "unexpected" call to `timer`.

Using the Rust CDK, the recurring timer is also lost on upgrade as explained in the API documentation of [set_timer_interval](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/0.6.9/ic_cdk/timer/fn.set_timer_interval.html).

### Recommendation

- In Motoko canisters, global timers should be set up in the actor initialiser for canister installation or re-installation. Canister-wide timers should be set in the `post_upgrade` hook for upgrades, as timers do not survive upgrades and must be explicitly set up thereafter.
