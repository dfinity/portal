# Security best practices: Identity and access management

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Security", "Concept"]} />

## Make sure any action that only a specific user should be able to do requires authentication

### Security concern

If this is not the case, an attacker may be able to perform sensitive actions on behalf of a user, compromising their account.

### Recommendation

- By design, for every canister call the caller can be identified. The calling [principal](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec.md#principals) can be accessed using the system API’s methods `ic0.msg_caller_size` and `ic0.msg_caller_copy` (see [here](../../references/ic-interface-spec.md#system-api-imports)). If e.g. Internet Identity is used, the principal is the user identity for this specific origin, see [here](../../references/ii-spec.md#identity-design-and-data-model). If some actions (e.g. access to user’s account data or account specific operations) should be restricted to a principal or a set of principals, then this must be explicitly checked in the canister call, for example as follows in Rust:

<!-- -->
```
// Let pk be the public key of a principal that is allowed to perform
// this operation. This pk could be stored in the canister's state.
if caller() != Principal::self_authenticating(pk) {  ic_cdk::trap(...) }

// Alternatively, if the canister keeps data for different principals
// in e.g. a map such as BTreeMap<Principal, UserData>, then the canister
// must ensure that each caller can only access and perform operations
// on their own data:
if let Some(user_data) = user_data_store.get_mut(&caller()) {
    // perform operations on the user's data
}
```
- In Rust, the `ic_cdk` crate can be used to authenticate the caller using `ic_cdk::api::caller`. Make sure the returned principal is of type `Principal::self_authenticating` and identify the user’s account using the public key of that principal, see the example code above.

- Do authentication as early as possible in the call to avoid unauthenticated actions and potentially expensive operations before authentication. It is also a good idea to [deny service to anonymous users](#disallow-the-anonymous-principal-in-authenticated-calls).

- Do not rely on authentication performed during [ingress message inspection](#do-not-rely-on-ingress-message-inspection).

## Disallow the anonymous principal in authenticated calls

### Security concern

The caller from the system API (e.g. `ic0::api::caller` in Rust) may also return `Principal::anonymous()`. In authenticated calls, this is probably undesired (and could have security implications) since this would behave like a shared account for anyone that does unauthenticated calls.

### Recommendation

In authenticated calls, make sure the caller is not anonymous and return an error or trap if it is. This could e.g. be done centrally by using a helper method. In Rust it could e.g. look as follows:
```rust
fn caller() -> Result<Principal, String> {
    let caller = ic0::api::caller();
    // The anonymous principal is not allowed to interact with canister.
    if caller == Principal::anonymous() {
        Err(String::from(
            "Anonymous principal not allowed to make calls.",
        ))
    } else {
        Ok(caller)
    }
}
```

## Do not rely on ingress message inspection

### Security concern

The correct execution of [canister_inspect_message](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-inspect-message) is not guaranteed because it is executed by a single node and if that node is malicious, it can e.g. simply skip this check. In that case the update call would be executed without any message inspection checks.

Also note that for inter-canister calls `canister_inspect_message` is not invoked.

### Recommendation

Your canisters should not rely on the correct execution of `canister_inspect_message`. This in particular means that no security critical code, such as [access control checks](#make-sure-any-action-that-only-a-specific-user-should-be-able-to-do-requires-authentication), should be solely performed in that method. Such checks **must** be performed as part of an update method to guarantee reliable execution. Ideally, they are executed both in the `canister_inspect_message` function and a guard function.

## Use a well-audited authentication service and client side ICP libraries

### Security concern

Implementing user authentication and canister calls yourself in your web app is error prone and risky. For example, if canister calls are implemented from scratch, there may be bugs around signature creation or verification.

### Recommendation

-   Consider using e.g. [Internet Identity](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity) for authentication, use [agent-js](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js) for making canister calls, and the [auth-client](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/tree/main/packages/auth-client) for interacting with internet identity from your dapp.

-   It is of course also an option to consider alternative authentication frameworks on ICP for authentication.

## Set an appropriate session timeout

### Security concern

Currently, Internet Identity issues delegations with an expiry time. This expiry time can be set in the [auth-client](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/tree/main/packages/auth-client). After a delegation expires, the user has to re-authenticate. Setting a good value is a trade-off between security and usability.

### Recommendation

See the [OWASP recommendations](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#session-expiration). A timeout of 30 min should be set for security sensitive applications.

The [auth-client](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/tree/main/packages/auth-client) supports idle timeouts. More details available [here](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/tree/main/packages/auth-client#idle-management).

## Don’t use fetchRootKey in agent-js in production

### Security concern

`agent.fetchRootKey()` can be used in [agent-js](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js) to fetch the root subnet threshold public key from a status call in test environments. This key is used to verify threshold signatures on certified data received through canister update calls. Using this method in a production web app gives an attacker the option to supply their own public key, invalidating all authenticity guarantees of update responses.

### Recommendation

Never use `agent.fetchRootKey()` in production builds, only in test builds. Not calling this method will result in the hard coded root subnet public key of the mainnet being used for signature verification, which is the desired behavior in production.
