# Using webpack

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

Webpack is a popular and highly configurable module bundler for JavaScript-based applications. New projects created with `dfx new` that choose to create a default JavaScript frontend include a default `webpack.config.js` file that makes it easy to add specific modules such as `react` and `markdown`.

## Entry and output configuration

In many cases, you can use the default `webpack.config.js` file as is, without any modification, or you can add
plugins, modules, and other custom configurations to suit your needs. The specific changes you make to
the `webpack.config.js` configuration largely depends on the other tools and frameworks you want to use.

For example, if you have experimented with the [using the default frontend canister](default-frontend.mdx)
or [using CSS to style frontends](add-stylesheet.mdx) tutorials, you might have modified the following section to work with React
JavaScript:

```js
module: {
  rules: [
    { test: /\.(ts|tsx|jsx)$/, loader: "ts-loader" },
    { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader','css-loader'] }
  ]
}
```

If your application does not use `dfx` to run your build script, you can provide the variables yourself. For example:

```
export DFX_NETWORK=ic 
export NODE_ENV=production 
export HELLO_CANISTER_ID=j2o3j-fiaaa-aaaab-qbifa-cai
npm run build
```

### Ensuring Node.js is available in a project

Because projects rely on webpack to provide the framework for the default frontend, you must have `Node.js` `16.0.0` or newer installed in
your development environment and accessible in the project directory.

- If you want to develop your project without using the default webpack configuration and canister aliases, you can remove the `frontend` canister from the `dfx.json` file or build your project using a specific canister name. For example, you can choose to build only the `hello` program's backend canister without building the frontend assets by running the following command:

```
dfx build hello_backend
```

- If you are using the default webpack configuration and running `dfx build` fails, you should try running `npm install` in the project directory and then re-running `dfx build`.

- If running `npm install` in the project directory doesn’t fix the issue, you should check the configuration of the `webpack.config.js` file for syntax errors.

## Using other bundlers

You may want to use a bundler other than webpack. Per-bundler instructions are not ready yet, but if you are familiar with your bundler, the following steps should get you going:

- #### Step 1: Remove the `copy:types`, `prestart`, and `prebuild` scripts from `package.json`.

- #### Step 2: Run `dfx deploy` to generate the local bindings for your canisters.

- #### Step 3: Copy the generated bindings to a directory where you would like to keep them.

- #### Step 4: Modify `declarations/<canister_name>/index.js` and replace `process.env.<CANISTER_NAME>_CANISTER_ID` with the equivalent pattern for environment variables for your bundler.

Alternately, hardcode the canister ID if that is your preferred workflow.

- #### Step 5: Commit the declarations and import them in your codebase.

## Deploying a frontend canister without building frontend dependencies

If you'd like to deploy a frontend asset canister without building the node or npm dependency packages, you can manually download the Wasm module `dfx` uses for its default frontend canister and install the canister manually.

- #### Step 1: Download `dfx`'s asset canister's Wasm module.

```
wget https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/raw/0.15.2/src/distributed/assetstorage.wasm.gzand
```

- #### Step 2: Install the canister.

```
dfx canister install <id instead of name> --wasm assetstorage.wasm.gz
```

Using the canister ID, the canister will not sync automatically. If you want the canister to sync according to the configuration in `dfx.json`, then use the canister name instead of the canister ID:

```
dfx canister install frontend_canister --wasm assetstorage.wasm.gz
```

To sync assets to the canister manually, you can use `icx-asset sync`, but this package must be installed with Rust: `cargo install icx-asset`.


## Webpack dev server

Starting with `dfx v0.7.7`, the SDK now provides you with `webpack-dev-server` in the `dfx new` starter.

The webpack development server, `webpack-dev-server`, provides in-memory access to the webpack assets, enabling you to make changes and see them reflected in the browser right away using live reloading.

- #### Step 1: Create a new project and navigate  into your project directory.

- #### Step 2: Start the replica locally, if necessary, with the `dfx start --clean --background` command.

Then, deploy your dapp as you normally would by running the `dfx deploy` command.

- #### Step 3: Start the webpack development server by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

- #### Step 4: Open a web browser and navigate to the asset canister for your application using the URL returned in the command line. For example, this might be:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

- #### Step 5: Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to your project directory.

- #### Step 6: Open the `src/hello_frontend/src/index.js` file for your project in a code editor and make changes to the content.

For example, you might add an element to the page using JavaScript:

```js
document.body.onload = addElement;

function addElement () {
 // Create a new div element
 const newDiv = document.createElement("div");

 // Give it some content
 const newContent = document.createTextNode("Test live page reloading!");

 // Add the text node to the newly created div
 newDiv.appendChild(newContent);

 // Add the newly created element and its content into the DOM
 const currentDiv = document.getElementById("div1");
 document.body.insertBefore(newDiv, currentDiv);
}
```

- #### Step 7: Save your changes to the `index.js` file.

- #### Step 8: Refresh the browser or wait for it to refresh on its own to see your change.

When you are done working on the frontend for your project, you can stop the webpack development server by pressing `Control-C`.
