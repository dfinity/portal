# Hosting application frontends using an asset canister

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

When a dapp is deployed to ICP, it has the ability to host web assets natively. An ICP project's frontend is commonly referred to as the **frontend canister**, as it is a canister that hosts the frontend of the application.

Dapps may have complex frontends that serve dynamic, interactive interfaces, or they can be simple, static webpages using HTML and CSS. Web assets can come in many forms, such as CSS, JavaScript, React, HTML, images, videos, or streaming content. Most web apps contain a combination of several assets and frameworks together.

## What is an asset canister?

When a project has a frontend canister configured in its `dfx.json` file, `dfx` will compile the project's web assets into an **asset canister**. An asset canister is a special type of custom canister that uses Rust to compile the project's asset files into a Wasm module that can be installed and deployed to ICP. This is because canisters deployed on ICP must have a Wasm module.

## Application URLs

Frontend canisters serve the application's web assets via a URL that contains the <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>'s ID. Local deployments use local URLs such as `http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=<canister-id>`, while applications deployed to the mainnet use public URLs containing the canister's ID followed by `.ic0.app`, `.icp0.io` or `raw.icp0.io`.

### Raw HTTP interfaces

The `raw.icp0.io` domain provides a way to access the raw HTTP interface of that canister. For local deployments that want to simulate the behavior of the `raw.icp0.io` domain, you must implement a method in your canister that consumes an HTTP request and outputs an HTTP response. Here is an example written in Motoko:

```motoko no-repl
public shared(msg) func http_request(req: HttpRequest) : async HttpResponse {
    {
        status = { code = 200; reason = "OK" };
        headers = [( "Content-Type", "text/plain" )];
        body = Text.encodeUtf8("Hello, World!");
    }
};
```

## Default `dfx` project configuration

By default, each project created with `dfx new` will include a frontend canister unless the `--no-frontend` flag is used. `dfx` supports default templates for the SvelteKit, React, Vue, and Vanilla JS frameworks, or you can select "No JS template" if you'd like no frontend template to be used.

Frontend canisters will be defined in your project's `dfx.json` file as `PROJECT_NAME_frontend`.

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "PROJECT_NAME_backend": {
      "main": "src/PROJECT_NAME_backend/main.mo",
      "type": "motoko"
    },
    "PROJECT_NAME_frontend": {
      "dependencies": [
        "PROJECT_NAME_backend"
      ],
      "source": [
        "src/PROJECT_NAME_frontend/dist"
      ],
      "type": "assets",
      "workspace": "PROJECT_NAME_frontend"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "args": "",
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env",
  "version": 1
}
```

Frontend canisters have the following default configuration settings:

- Frontend assets for your project are compiled into their own canister. In this case, a canister named `PROJECT_NAME_frontend`.

- The `PROJECT_NAME_frontend` canister has a default dependency on the `PROJECT_NAME_backend` canister for the project.

- The `source` setting specifies the paths to the `src` directory that are used for the web assets that will be compiled into your `PROJECT_NAME_frontend` canister when you build the project.

- The `type` setting specifies that the `PROJECT_NAME_frontend` should be deployed using the [asset canister](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/tree/master/src/canisters/frontend/ic-frontend-canister), which compiles the web assets listed in `source` into a Wasm module.

### Default frontend canister files

The default files included in the frontend canister will depend on the framework you chose when you created your project, or you can use an [existing application frontend](existing-frontend.mdx).

## Example frontend canisters

A few example frontend canisters you can reference include:

- [ICP Ninja sample projects](https://icp.ninja).

- [Minimal counter dapp](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/minimal-counter-dapp/src/minimal_dapp_frontend).

- [Random maze](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/random_maze/src/random_maze_assets).
