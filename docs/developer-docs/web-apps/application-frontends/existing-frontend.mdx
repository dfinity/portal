# Using an existing application frontend 

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

While numerous starter projects and examples exist for those who prefer to start from scratch, deploying an existing application frontend as a frontend <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> is also a viable option for building an application on ICP.

Server methods such as `getServerSideProps` are not supported, since it will be deployed as a client-only application.

## Using a Next.js frontend

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source web development framework providing React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static website generation.

[View the GitHub repo for this example](https://github.com/jennifertrin/nextjsicp).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="prereq" label="Prerequisites" default>

<input type="checkbox"/> <a href="/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install">Install the IC SDK.</a>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- #### Step 1: Build your Next.js application.

To start, you must generate static files and build your Next.js application. To generate the static files, add this line to your `next.config.js` file:

```js
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
};
```

:::danger
Please note that you may have existing settings that you should avoid overwriting.
:::

Then, build your Next.js application by running the appropriate build command. You should reference your `package.json`'s `scripts` section to determine the correct build command.
 For example, if you are using npx:

```bash
npx run build
```

This should generate an `out` folder, which consists of the static assets that make up the frontend.

- #### Step 2: Create a `dfx.json` file

In the top-level directory of your repository, add a `dfx.json` file containing the following content:

```json
{
    "canisters": {
        "frontend": {
          "entrypoint": "out/index.html"
        "source": ["out"],
        "type": "assets"
      }
    },
    "output_env_file": ".env"
}
```

`dfx.json` is the configuration file used for configuring and deploying your app to ICP as a canister. In this example, this file is configuring a canister called 'app'. Note that you can adjust `app` to refer to the name of your canister. Also, make sure that these point to the correct files:

- `"entrypoint": "out/index.html"`: The index or entrance point for the application's files.

- `"source": ["out"]`: The directory hosting the application's web assets.

- #### Step 3: Generate Candid definitions.

Run the following command to generate the correct [Candid](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/candid/candid-concepts) type definitions:

```
dfx generate
```

- #### Step 4: Deploy the project.

Then, you can deploy the Next.js application locally for testing:

```
dfx deploy
```

Or, you can deploy directly on the mainnet:

```
dfx deploy --network ic
```

:::info
Deploying to the mainnet will cost [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/tokens-and-cycles).
:::

After running either command, you will see a generated link that is now hosting your Next.js application. The local url will be in the format `http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=<canister-id>`, while the mainnet URL will be in the format `https://<canister-id>.icp0.io/`.

- #### Step 5: Open the application.

Navigate to the frontend canister using the URL you received in the last step.
