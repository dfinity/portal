# Using an existing frontend application

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

While numerous starter projects and examples exist for those who prefer to start from scratch, deploying an existing frontend application as a frontend <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> is also a viable option for building an application on ICP.

This guide provides an overview of how to deploy an existing Next.js application as a frontend canister.

:::caution
Server methods such as `getServerSideProps` are not supported, since it will be deployed as a client-only application.
:::

## Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source web development framework providing React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static website generation.

[View the GitHub repo for this example](https://github.com/jennifertrin/nextjsicp).

### Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have:

- [x] Downloaded and installed [`dfx`](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/releases/latest).

- [x] An existing Next.js application. This guide will use the [Next.js ICP example](https://github.com/jennifertrin/nextjsicp).

### Step 1: Build your Next.js application

To start, you must generate static files and build your Next.js application. To generate the static files, add this line to your `next.config.js` file:

```js
output: 'export'
```

Your `next.config.js` file should resemble the following:

```js
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
};
```

Please note that you may have existing settings that you should avoid overriding.

Then, build your Next.js application by running the appropriate build command. For example, if you are using npx:

```bash
npx run build
```

You should reference your `package.json` `scripts` section to determine the correct build command.

This should generate an `out` folder, which consists of the static assets that make up the frontend.

:::info
When deploying on ICP, these static files are not public to anyone, including the nodes. Only the Wasm file, which is a binary instruction file that does not leak any of your code, is public.
:::

### Step 2: Create a `dfx.json` file

In the top-level directory of your repository, add a `dfx.json` file containing the following content:

```json
{
    "canisters": {
      "app": {
        "frontend": {
          "entrypoint": "out/index.html"
        },
        "source": ["out"],
        "type": "assets"
      }
    },
    "output_env_file": ".env"
}
```

`dfx.json` is the configuration file for deploying your to ICP as a canister. In this example, this file is configuring a canister called 'app'. Note that you can adjust `app` to refer to the name of your canister. Also, make sure that these point to the correct files:

- `"entrypoint": "out/index.html"`

- `"source": ["out"]`

### Step 3: Generate Candid definitions

Run the following command to generate the correct [Candid](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/candid/candid-concepts) type definitions:

```
dfx generate
```

### Step 4: Deploy the project

Then, you can deploy the Next.js application locally for testing:

```
dfx deploy
```

Or, you can deploy directly on the mainnet:

```
dfx deploy --network ic
```

:::info
Deploying to the mainnet will cost [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/tokens-and-cycles).
:::

After running either command, you will see a generated link that is now hosting your Next.js application. The local url will be in the format `http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=<canister-id>`, while the mainnet URL will be in the format `https://<canister-id>.icp0.io/`.

### Step 5: Navigate to the frontend canister to view the application

Navigate to the frontend canister using the URL you received in the last step.
