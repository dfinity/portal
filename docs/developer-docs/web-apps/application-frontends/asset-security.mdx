# Asset security

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Concept"]} />



You can configure how a frontend <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> responds to requests for specific assets by defining your
desired configuration in a file named `.ic-assets.json` Each entry in `.ic-assets.json` allows for specifying a [glob](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/glob-patterns) pattern along with the headers to be returned in the response for any file that matches the pattern. You may also dictate whether redirects are performed from the non-certified endpoint to a certified endpoint for any given filename pattern.

## Content Security Policies (CSP)

By default, frontend canisters created with `dfx new` contain the following Content Security Policy (CSP) in the project's `.ic-assets.json` file:

```
"Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self';script-src 'self';connect-src 'self' http://localhost:* https://icp0.io https://*.icp0.io https://icp-api.io;img-src 'self' data:;style-src * 'unsafe-inline';style-src-elem * 'unsafe-inline';font-src *;object-src 'none';base-uri 'self';frame-ancestors 'none';form-action 'self';upgrade-insecure-requests;",
```

This CSP includes `img-src data` as data images are frequently included in frontend interfaces, and `frame-ancestors: none` is used to mitigate [clickjacking attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking).

## Security recommendations

This default Content Security Policy aims to work with as many applications as possible rather than providing the maximum security. It is recommended that you update this policy for your application's specific needs by utilizing tools such as:

- Use the [CSP Evaluator](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/) tool to validate your security policy.

- Follow these CSP [recommendations](https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html). Note that on ICP, nonces cannot be used because the response bodies must be static to work well with HTTP asset certification.

- It is recommended to include [script hashes in combination with strict-dynamic](https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/faq.html) in the CSP to account for not using nonces.

- Tighten the `connect-src` directive, as the default CSP allows for any canister to be called via `https://icp0.io/api/v2/canister/{canister-ID}`.

- Configure `style-src`, `style-src-elem` and `font-src` directives instead of using the wildcard (*) option.

View more details on the [default CSP](/docs/current/references/asset-canister).

### `dfx v0.21.0` and older

`dfx` versions `0.21.0` and older include `script-src 'unsafe-eval'` in the default security policy. This is required for older versions because previous versions of the [ICP JavaScript agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/agent) used a WebAssembly module for the BLS signature validation. This has since been removed and is no longer included in the most recent versions of `dfx`.

If you are using an older version of `dfx`, we recommend updating your security policy to remove the `script-src 'unsafe-eval'` portion.
