# User authentication: Email & password

## Overview

For some dapps, authenticating with a traditional email and password method may be desired. To support this workflow, [NFID](https://nfid.one/) can be used. NFID is a form of digital identity with a backend built entirely on ICP. It supports authentication with dapps through an email and password login or an existing Google account.
