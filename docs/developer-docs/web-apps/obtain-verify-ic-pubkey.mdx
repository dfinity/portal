# Verifying the public key

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

When a user or canister receives a response from ICP, that response will have a certificate that validates the response has not been altered or changed. This certificate is signed by the root of trust, which is the ICP root public key. This public key can be used to additionally verify that a user or canister is interacting with a version of ICP that has not been tampered with, verifying that the response's certificate is valid.

### Local

In a local canister execution environment, the key can be fetched via the [`/api/v2/status`](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#api-status) endpoint.

### Mainnet

On the mainnet, you can use [the ICP JavaScript agent](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js) or [agent-rs](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-rs) to fetch the public key, as these agents have the root key [hard-coded](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/blob/main/packages/agent/src/agent/proxy.ts#L244C1-L250C2).

## Verifying the public key

Once you have obtained the public key, you can validate it is correct by using `dfx` to ping the network you're using, such as:

```bash
dfx ping ic // mainnet
dfx ping local // local canister execution
```

This ping command will return the public root key of the network specified:
