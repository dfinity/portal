# NFT marketplaces

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "NFTs", "Tutorial"]} />



An NFT marketplace is a dapp used to mint, buy, sell, and trade NFTs. An NFT listed on a marketplace may be part of a large collection, or it may be a one-of-a-kind token.

To list an NFT collection on a marketplace, you will need the metadata for each token in the collection. Metadata fields typically include the token's name, symbol, description, image, and any unique attributes that the token holds, such as a rarity score or access to a gated website. Once the collection's data is uploaded, the developer must set a mint price, configure royalties, and set up any other necessary payment information.

Usually, a collection's information is uploaded to the marketplace before any of the tokens in the collection have been minted. Then, users can interact with the marketplace and mint NFTs from your collection directly to their wallet by paying the set mint fee.

Once all of the NFTs in a collection have been minted, users who hold an NFT can list it on the market for resale. The resale price may be different than the initial mint price based on the current market conditions, if the token has some rare metadata attributes, or if the collection is highly sought after.

NFTs do not have to be bought and sold on the same marketplace that they were minted through; in fact, some NFT collections are minted through a project's dedicated minting website rather than through a marketplace at all. NFTs can be listed on any marketplace that supports the NFT's token standard.
