# Direct transfer of tokens

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial" ]} />

## Overview

The request type that is used for making direct transfers is `TRANSFER`. In the simplest form it consists of two operations, one for the debit operation and one for the credit operation. 

:::info
You do not have to specify the `FEE` operation, although the `FEE` of the ICRC-1 ledger will be deducted automatically by Rosetta.
The call may include a `FEE` operation to not overlook unexpected debit operations. 
:::

### Prerequisites 
- Make sure you are familiar with the [flow of operations](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/operations_flow/index.mdx) for Rosetta.  

## Transfer tokens

An example of the minimum set of operations that is sent to the `construction/payloads` endpoint can be found below.
In this example, you are sending 10 e8 ckBTC from principal `iowfl-yzooa-br3dt-77erl-nlm7f-kplhq-php75-hw3an-aeqn2-swh4t-3qe` to principal `xmiu5-jqaaa-aaaag-qbz7q-cai`.
