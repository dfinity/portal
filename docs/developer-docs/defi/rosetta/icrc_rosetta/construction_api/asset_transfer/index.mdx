# Asset transfers

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial" ]} />

## Overview
This section will give you an overview on what types of asset transfers are supported by ICRC Rosetta and how to use them. 
It is divided in the following topics:


- [Transfer](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/data_api/network.mdx): Fetch network specific information, such as the most recent block and what network Rosetta is connected to. 
- [Approve](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/data_api/balances.mdx): Fetch the balance of an `account_identifier` or a neuron.
