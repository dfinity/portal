# Approve a spender

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial" ]} />

## Overview

This section will show you how to use the ICRC Rosetta implementation to authorize a spender to spend your ICRC-1 tokens. Make sure you are familiar with the [flow of operations](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/operations_flow/index.mdx) for Rosetta.  
The request types used for making direct transfers are `APPROVE` and `SPENDER`. They consist of two operations, one for the the approve operation and another for the spender operation. 
:::info
You do not have to specify the `FEE` operation, although the `FEE` of the ICRC-1 ledger `FEE` will be deducted automatically by Rosetta. 
Calls may include a `FEE` operation to not overlook unexpected debit operations. 
:::
### Prerequisites 
- Make sure you are familiar with the [flow of operations](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/operations_flow/index.mdx) for Rosetta.  
An example of the minimum set of operations that is sent to the `construction/payloads` endpoint can be found below.
In this example, you are approving the principal `xmiu5-jqaaa-aaaag-qbz7q-cai` to spend up to 10 e8 ckBTC from principal `iowfl-yzooa-br3dt-77erl-nlm7f-kplhq-php75-hw3an-aeqn2-swh4t-3qe`.
