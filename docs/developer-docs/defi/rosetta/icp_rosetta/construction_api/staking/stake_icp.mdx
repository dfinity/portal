This section of the staking tutorial will show you how to use the ICP that was previously sent to the governance account identifier corresponding to your public key. You can use this ICP to create and fund a neuron.

The full amount of ICP that was sent to the governance account identifier will be used for staking. 

A call to the endpoint `construction/payloads` would resemble the following.

```json
curl --location '0.0.0.0:8081/construction/payloads'  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{
  "network_identifier": {
    "blockchain": "Internet Computer",
    "network": "00000000000000020101"
  },
  "public_keys": [
    {
      "hex_bytes": "047a83e378053f87b49aeae53b3ed274c8b2ffbe59d9a51e3c4d850ca8ac1684f7131b778317c0db04de661c7d08321d60c0507868af41fe3150d21b3c6c757367",
      "curve_type": "secp256k1"
    }
  ],
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation_identifier": {
        "index": 0
      },
      "type": "STAKE",
      "account": {
        "address": "8b84c3a3529d02a9decb5b1a27e7c8d886e17e07ea0a538269697ef09c2a27b4"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "neuron_index": 0
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": null
}'
```

The transaction's returned output will resemble the following:
```json
{'transaction_identifier': {'hash': '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'}, 'metadata': {'operations': [{'account': {'address': '8b84c3a3529d02a9decb5b1a27e7c8d886e17e07ea0a538269697ef09c2a27b4'}, 'metadata': {'neuron_id': 3094748712371737240, 'neuron_index': 0}, 'operation_identifier': {'index': 0}, 'status': 'COMPLETED', 'type': 'STAKE'}]}}
```

Neuron management operations don’t strictly adhere to the Rosetta specification. If the transaction only contains the neuron management operations (like the example above), the returned transaction hash won’t be on the ICP ledger chain. The returned transaction hash does not make any sense for governance operations and is thus left blank. 

The governance canister will take your public key and the neuron index provided (in this case it was 0) and either create a new `neuron_id` or add the ICP to an already existing neuron with the same derived `neuron_id`. In this case the neuron with the `neuron_id` `3094748712371737240` was created. 

:::info
The `neuron_id` is an internal representation of neurons on the governance canister. The neuron index corresponds to the index of neurons that a certain public key controls. Taking the public key `047a83e378053f87b49aeae53b3ed274c8b2ffbe59d9a51e3c4d850ca8ac1684f7131b778317c0db04de661c7d08321d60c0507868af41fe3150d21b3c6c757367`, the index `0` and given how many existing neurons already exist,
the governance canister arrives at the `neuron_id` `3094748712371737240`
