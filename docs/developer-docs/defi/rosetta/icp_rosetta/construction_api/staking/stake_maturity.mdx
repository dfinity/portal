Once you have a neuron starts accumulating maturity, you can either decide to leave the maturity as it is until you decide to convert it to ICP, or you can make use of it and stake it in addition to your ICP. To do the latter, you will have to stake your maturity. 

## Staking maturity

You can set how much of the existing maturity you want to stake. The maturity needs to be larger than zero for the operation to work. In the following example command, 100% of the maturity is staked.
