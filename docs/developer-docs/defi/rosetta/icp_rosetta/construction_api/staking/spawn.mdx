# Spawn a neuron

## Overview

|----------------------|------------|

| Idempotent?          | yes        |
| Minimal access level | controller |

In this section you will learn how to split a neuron and spawn a new one out of your existing neuron.
The `SPAWN` operation transfers all the maturity from the existing neuron to the staked amount of the newly spawned neuron.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Prerequisites:**

</div>

-   `account.address` is a ledger address of a neuron controller.

-   The parent neuron has at least 1 ICP worth of maturity.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Postconditions:**

</div>

-   Parent neuron maturity is set to `0`.

-   A new neuron is spawned with a balance equal to the transferred maturity.

An example command to spawn a new neuron looks like the following. Make sure to give the `spawned_neuron_index` a different index than the parent neuron.
``` json
curl --location '0.0.0.0:8081/construction/payloads'  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{
{
  "operation_identifier": { "index": 0 },
  "type": "SPAWN",
  "account": { "address": "907ff6c714a545110b42982b72aa39c5b7742d610e234a9d40bf8cf624e7a70d" },
  "metadata": {
    "neuron_index": 0,

      "principal": "sp3em-jkiyw-tospm-2huim-jor4p-et4s7-ay35f-q7tnm-hi4k2-pyicb-xae"
    },
    "spawned_neuron_index": 1,
    "percentage_to_spawn": 75
  }
}'
```

:::info

- `spawned_neuron_index` metadata field is required. The rosetta node uses this index to compute the subaccount for the spawned neuron. All spawned neurons must have different values of `spawned_neuron_index`.

- `controller` metadata field is optional and equal to the existing neuron controller by default.

- `percentage_to_spawn` metadata field is optional and equal to 100 by default. If specified, the value must be an integer between 1 and 100 (bounds included).
