This section will give you an overview of how to vote on NNS proposals using Rosetta. 
This tutorial assumes the following:

- You are familiar with the [flow of operations](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/operations_flow/index.mdx). 

- You have a Rosetta instance running at: `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.

- You are familiar with the concept of staking and voting on the NNS in general. To read up on how these concepts work,
you can look at the [NNS documentation](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/overview).
