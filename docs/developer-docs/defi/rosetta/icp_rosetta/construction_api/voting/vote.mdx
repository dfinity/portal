This section will show you how to use Rosetta to vote on existing proposals. 

### Fetch existing proposals
First you will need to know which proposals currenty exist on the NNS. You can read up on how to do this [here](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/data_api/get_pending_proposals.mdx). 
If you already know the proposal id you want to vote on you can also [fetch](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/data_api/get_proposal_info.mdx) the information about the proposal to check that what your are voting on is what you expected. 

### Vote on a proposal
In this tutorial you will be voting on the proposal with the proposal id `12`. 
You also have to decide on what to vote, meaning:
- Register a vote, but neither vote for nor against the proposal: 0
- Vote for the proposal to be adopted: 1
- Vote for the proposal to be rejected: 2

In this case, you will be voting against the proposal. 
An example call for the `construction/payloads` endpoint resembles the following:
```
curl --location '0.0.0.0:8081/construction/payloads'  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{
  "network_identifier": {
    "blockchain": "Internet Computer",
    "network": "00000000000000020101"
  },
  "public_keys": [

    }
  ],

      },
      "metadata": {
        "neuron_index": 1,
        "proposal": 12,
