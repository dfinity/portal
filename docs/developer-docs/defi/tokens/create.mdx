# Create a token

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

Custom tokens can be created and deployed on ICP using the [ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-1) or [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-2) token standards.

The ICRC-1 standard is considered the 'base' standard, as it defines a set of general functionalities that all ledgers must adhere to. Any tokens and their corresponding ledgers must fulfill all requirements of the ICRC-1 standard. Read about [token standards](token-standards.mdx) to learn more about what token standards are and the functionalities each one supports.

This guide will provide a quickstart on how you can create and deploy your own custom token using the ICRC-1 standard. 

## Setup a local ICRC-1 ledger

To create a new ICRC-1 token, you will need to first download and configure a local project for the ICRC-1 <GlossaryTooltip>ledger</GlossaryTooltip> <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>. This is because each token will need its own ledger canister to record the token's balances and transactions. [Follow the ICRC-1 ledger documentation for instructions](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/ledger/setup/icrc1_ledger_setup).

## Export token settings

:::info
The initialization arguments of the ICRC-1 ledger are not specified in the [standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md). Thus, the arguments defined in this section are dependent on the reference implementation of the ICRC-1 ledger. If you build your own ICRC-1 ledger, you may use different initialization arguments.
:::

To create a token, you will need to record several values. The full list can be found below:

#### `PRE_MINTED_TOKENS`

Amount of tokens that are minted during deployment for a specific account. In this tutorial, it will be the `DEFAULT` account.

```
dfx identity use default
echo $(dfx identity get-principal)
```

#### `TRANSFER_FEE`

Fee that users of the ledger will have to pay anytime they want to make a transfer.

#### `ARCHIVE_CONTROLLER`

The [controller <GlossaryTooltip>principal</GlossaryTooltip>](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/cycles/cycles-wallet#controller-and-custodian-roles) of the archive canisters.

```
dfx identity new archive_controller
dfx identity use archive_controller
echo $(dfx identity get-principal)
```

#### `TRIGGER_THRESHOLD`

The number of blocks to archive when the trigger threshold is exceeded.

#### `CYCLE_FOR_ARCHIVE_CREATION`

The number of cycles that will be sent to the archive canister when it is created.

#### `NUM_OF_BLOCK_TO_ARCHIVE`

The number of blocks that will be archived.

#### `TOKEN_NAME`

The name of your token.

#### `TOKEN_SYMBOL`

The ticker symbol of your new token.

#### `MINTER`

The account of the principal responsible for minting and burning tokens (see the [ICRC-1 specification](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1)). Transfers from the minting account will generate `Mint` transactions, resulting in the creation of new tokens. To mint tokens, the minting account must call the `icrc1_transfer` function, specifying the recipient in the 'to' value.

Transfers sent to the minting account will generate `Burn` transactions, destroying tokens. An `icrc1_transfer` call from any principal with the 'to' value set as the minting account will burn tokens.

```
dfx identity new minter
dfx identity use minter
echo $(dfx identity get-principal)
```

#### `FEATURE_FLAGS`

A flag for enabling or disabling certain extension standards to the ICRC-1 standard. In this case, the reference implementation can also support ICRC-2 transactions.

If you only want to support the ICRC-1 standard, then you can set the flag to `false`. If you want to also support the ICRC-2 standard, set it to `true`.

## Edit the project's dfx.json file

Replace the existing content in the `dfx.json` with the following, updating the values of `TOKEN_SYMBOL`, `TOKEN_NAME`, `MINTER`, `TRANSFER_FEE`, `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID`, `PRE_MINTED_TOKENS`, `NUM_OF_BLOCKS_TO_ARCHIVE`, `TRIGGER_THRESHOLD`, and `ARCHIVE_CONTROLLER` with the values obtained in the previous steps:

:::info
`dfx.json` does not support referring to values through environment variables. Values must be hardcoded in plain text.
:::

```json
{
    "canisters": {
        "icrc1_ledger_canister": {
            "type": "custom",
            "candid": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/<REVISION>/rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did",
            "wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/<REVISION>/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz",
            "init_arg": "(variant {Init = record { token_symbol = "TOKEN_SYMBOL"; token_name = "TOKEN_NAME"; minting_account = record { owner = principal "MINTER" transfer_fee = TRANSFER_FEE; metadata = vec {}; feature_flags = opt record{icrc2 = false}; initial_balances = vec { record { record { owner = principal "DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID"; }; "PRE_MINTED_TOKENS"; }; }; archive_options = record { num_blocks_to_archive = "NUM_OF_BLOCK_TO_ARCHIVE"; trigger_threshold = "TRIGGER_THRESHOLD"; controller_id = principal "ARCHIVE_CONTROLLER"; cycles_for_archive_creation = opt "10000000000000"; }; }} })" },
            },
    "defaults": {
        "build": {
            "args": "",
            "packtool": ""
        }
        },
    "output_env_file": ".env",
    "version": 1
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass these init arguments to the canister through the command line. [Learn more about canister init arguments](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/advanced-dfx/init-args).

## Deploy the ledger locally

:::caution
Deploying to the playground is ICP's equivalent of deploying to a testnet network.

In this workflow, you cannot deploy this canister to the playground (using the flag `dfx deploy --playground`) because it does not accept gzipped Wasm files.
:::

Deploy the ICRC-1 ledger canister locally and pass in the arguments to create your token.

``` sh
dfx start --clean --background
dfx deploy icrc1_ledger_canister --specified-id mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai
```

For additional details, you can learn more in the [ICRC-1 ledger documentation](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/ledger/setup/icrc1_ledger_setup).

Your token has been created locally. To interact with your token, [learn how to interact with the ICRC-1 ledger](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/indexes).

## Deploying your token to the mainnet

If you want to deploy your ICRC-1 token on the mainnet, follow these steps:

- Remove the `--specified-id` flag. Your ledger canister will receive a unique canister ID when deployed on the mainnet.

- Specify the initially minted token value by setting `initial_values = vec {<INITIAL_VALUES>}`. View the `ledger.did` file for the details of the argument.

- Add the `--network ic` flag to the command to deploy to the mainnet.

- Confirm that the `archive_options` field is set. If archiving is disabled, your ledger's memory capacity will be limited to that of a single canister.

- Be sure that your ledger canister has cycles attached to the `create_canister` messages, using the `cycles_for_archive_creation`.
