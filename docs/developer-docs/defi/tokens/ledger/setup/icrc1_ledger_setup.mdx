# ICRC-1 ledger local setup

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate" , "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview
This guide will show you how to deploy an ICRC-1 ledger locally and on the mainnet. ICRC-1 is a [token standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1). Thus, deploying a new token that is ICRC-1-compatible is synonymous with deploying an ICRC-1 ledger.
The ICRC-1 ledger used in this guide is a reference implementation. This guide aims at showing you how to setup an existing ICRC-1 ledger implementation rather than how to build an ICRC-1 ledger yourself.


## Deploying the ledger locally

### Step 1:  Make sure you use a recent version of the [IC SDK](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install).
If you donâ€™t have the IC SDK installed, follow instructions on the [installing the IC SDK](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install) section to install it.

### Step 2: Create a new dfx project with the command:

```
dfx new icrc1_ledger_canister
cd icrc1_ledger_canister
```

:::caution

If using `dfx` version 0.17.1 or newer, choose 'Motoko' for the backend language, and 'No frontend canister' for the frontend language.

:::

### Step 3: Determine ledger file locations.

Go to the [releases overview](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/releases) and copy the latest replica binary revision. At the time of writing, this is `aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9`.

The URL for the ledger Wasm module is `https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/<REVISION>/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz`, so with the above revision it would be `https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz`.

The URL for the ledger .did file is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/<REVISION>/rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did`, so with the above revision it would be `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9/rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did`.


#### Optional:
If you want to make sure you have the latest ICRC-1 ledger files you can run the following script that downloads the files into your local directory:
``` sh
curl -o download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/aba60ffbc46acfc8990bf4d5685c1360bd7026b9/rs/rosetta-api/scripts/download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh"
chmod +x download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh
./download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh
```

These files will be used by the `dfx.json` file as described in the next step.

### Step 4: Configure the `dfx.json` file.
Open the `dfx.json` file in your project's directory. Replace the existing content with the following and make sure you replace `<REVISION>` in the `candid` and `wasm` URLs as shown in step 3:

``` json
{
  "canisters": {
    "icrc1_ledger_canister": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/<REVISION>/rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did",
      "wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/<REVISION>/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "args": "",
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env",
  "version": 1
}
```

If you chose to download the ICRC-1 ledger files with the script, you need to replace the Candid and Wasm file entries with the path to the files:

``` json
...
"candid": "icrc1_ledger.did",
"wasm" : "icrc1_ledger.wasm.gz"
  ...
```

In an existing project you would only need to add the `icrc1_ledger_canister` canister to the `canisters` section instead of replacing the entire content of `dfx.json`.

## Ledger test suite

There is a test suite available to [test ICRC-1 ledgers](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/test). If you are building your own ICRC-1 repository, it might be helpful to run this test suite against your locally deployed ICRC-1 ledger, or import the test suite directly through a Rust crate and add the tests to your repository. You can find a reference implementation of integrating the [test suite to your repo](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/test/ref).


## Next steps

Before you deploy your ledger canister, you will need to set some variables that you will pass to the canister during initialization that will create a new ICRC-1 or ICRC-2 token. To learn how to set these variables and deploy the ledger canister, see [create a token](/docs/developer-docs/defi/tokens/create.mdx).
