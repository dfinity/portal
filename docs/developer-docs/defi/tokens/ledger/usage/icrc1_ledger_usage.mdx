# Using an ICRC-1 ledger

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate" , "Tutorial"]} />

There are three primary methods used to interact with an ICRC-1 ledger:

- `dfx canister`: The generic canister call from `dfx` used to call a canister's methods.

- `ic-cdk`: Inter-canister calls for the ICRC-1 ledger.

- [`ledger-icrc-js`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/ledger-icrc): A library for interfacing with an ICRC-1 ledger on the Internet Computer.

## Interact with an ICRC-1 canister using `dfx canister call`

### ICRC-1

Use the following command syntax to interact with an ICRC-1 ledger via `dfx canister`:

```
dfx canister call <canister-id> <method-name> <arguments>
```

For example, to fetch the token symbol of an ICRC-1 ledger, call the `icrc1_symbol` method:

```
dfx canister call ss2fx-dyaaa-aaaar-qacoq-cai icrc1_symbol '()'
```

Whether your ICRC-1 ledger will have all available methods enabled will depend on if you choose to support any of the extensions of ICRC-1 (ICRC-2, ICRC-3,...).

You can always check which standards are supported by a certain ICRC-1 ledger by calling:

```
dfx canister call <canister-id> icrc1_supported_standards '()'
```

You can find all available methods for your ICRC-1 ledger within the ICRC-1 ledger canister's Candid file or, if your ICRC-1 ledger has been deployed to the mainnet, view your ICRC-1 ledger canister [on the dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canisters). An example of an ICRC-1 ledger deployed on the mainnet that you can reference is the [ckETH ledger canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ss2fx-dyaaa-aaaar-qacoq-cai).

View the [`dfx canister call` documentation](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-call) for more information on calling canister methods.


### ICRC-2

For ledgers that support ICRC-2, you can call ICRC-2 methods. ICRC-2 methods include those for `approve` workflows. For specifics, see the [ICRC-2 standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-2#icrc2_approve).

View the [`dfx canister call` documentation](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-call) for more information on calling canister methods.

## Interacting with an ICRC-1 ledger from your web application (`ledger-icrc-js`)

[View specifications and examples on how to use the `ledger-icrc-js` library to interact with ICRC-1 ledgers](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/ledger-icrc).

## Interacting with an ICRC-1 ledger from another canister (inter-canister calls via `ic-cdk`)

When calling into arbitrary ICRC-1 ledgers, we recommend you use [bounded wait (aka best-effort response) calls](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/async-code). These calls ensure that your canister does not get stuck waiting for a response from the ledger.

Here sample code to fetch the transfer fee from an ICRC-1 ledger using Rust and the `ic-cdk` [library](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs) from within a canister. The example includes retry logic to handle errors when possible.

```rust reference
https://github.com/oggy-dfin/icc_rust_docs/blob/f98d56a5ebd2fc4b63a73a8dd75494e80ac38146/src/icc_rust_docs_backend/src/lib.rs#L83-L126
```

Here's sample code for transferring ICRC-1 ledger tokens using bounded wait response calls. It handles the unknown state case by using the [transaction deduplication feature](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/icrc1-standard#transaction-deduplication-) of ICRC-1 ledgers.

```rust reference
https://github.com/oggy-dfin/icc_rust_docs/blob/49d042b9352f0298b6368985b0e5b927753efd38/src/icc_rust_docs_backend/src/lib.rs#L128-L192
```

You can find all available methods for your ICRC-1 ledger within the ICRC-1 ledger canister's Candid file or, if your ICRC-1 ledger has been deployed to the mainnet, view your ICRC-1 ledger canister [on the dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canisters). An example of an ICRC-1 ledger deployed on the mainnet that you can reference is the [ckETH ledger canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ss2fx-dyaaa-aaaar-qacoq-cai).


### `icrc-ledger-types` Rust crate

To interact with the ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 endpoints, the Rust crate [icrc-ledger-types](https://crates.io/crates/icrc-ledger-types) can be used.
This is true for the ICP ledger as well as any other canister that supports ICRC-1 or any of the ICRC-1 extension standards (i.e., ICRC-2, ICRC-3,...).

The crate can be installed with the command:

```
cargo add icrc-ledger-types
```

Or, it can be added to the `Cargo.toml` file:

```
icrc-ledger-types = "0.1.1"
```

[View the documentation for this crate](https://docs.rs/icrc-ledger-types/0.1.1/icrc_ledger_types/).
