# Asset flow

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate" , "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

When interacting with the [ICP or ICRC-1 ledgers](/docs/developer-docs//defi/overview.mdx), there are different asset flow operations that can be executed.  These operations are:

* **Transfer**: A simple transfer between two entities.
* **Approve**: Approving tokens to be spent by another entity.
* **Mint**: Creating new tokens (**Requires minting account privileges**).
* **Burn**: Destroying tokens.
* **TransferFrom**: Spend approved tokens on behalf of another entity.

Both ledger types support these operations. There are several ways on how to create transactions corresponding to each asset flow operation. This guide will demonstrate how to use `dfx` using `Rust` code.

### Prerequisites

* Download and install [`dfx`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-parent).

* Setup an [ICP Rust agent](https://crates.io/crates/ic-agent).

## Transfer tokens

To transfer tokens, your transaction will need the following required fields:

* `to`: The account that will receive the tokens.
* `amount`: The amount of tokens to be sent.

Additionally, the transaction takes the following optional fields:

* `from_subaccount`: The subaccount of the approver.
* `fee`: The fee paid by the sender for the transfer. If not set, the default fee will have to be paid.
* `memo`: An arbitrary 32 bytes array to ensure transaction hash uniqueness.
* `created_at_time`: A timestamp that is used to trigger the [deduplication mechanism](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md#transaction_deduplication).

### dfx
Here is an example command for a `Transfer` transaction using `dfx`:
```bash
dfx canister call icrc1_ledger_canister icrc1_transfer "(record { to = record { owner = principal \"sckqo-e2vyl-4rqqu-5g4wf-pqskh-iynjm-46ixm-awluw-ucnqa-4sl6j-mqe\";};  amount = 10_000;})"
```

### Rust
Here is an example Rust code snippet for making a `Transfer` transaction:
```bash
let to = icrc_ledger_types::icrc1::account::Account{ owner:ic_principal::Principal::from_slice(&[1, 2, 3, 4]) , subaccount: None};
let amount = candid::Nat::from(500u64);
let transfer_arg = icrc_ledger_types::icrc1::transfer::TransferArg{
    from_subaccount: None,
    to,
    amount,
    fee: None,
    memo: : None,
    created_at_time: : None,
}
candid::Decode!(&ic_agent.update("icrc1_transfer", &candid::Encode!(&transfer_arg)?).await.unwrap(), Result<candid::Nat, icrc_ledger_types::icrc1::transfer::TransferError>).unwrap();
```
:::info
Mint and burn operations are technically speaking also transfers. They work exactly like regular transfers with certain conditions that have to be met. They are the following:
* For **mint** operations, the sender of the transfer has to be the minter account. This means that if you want to make mint transactions, you will need to know the private key of the minter account. The recipient will receive the newly minted tokens.
* For **burn** operations, the receiver needs to be set to the mint account while the sender can be any account. You can request the minter account by calling the `icrc1_minting_account` endpoint of the ledger.

## Approve tokens
To approve tokens, your transaction will need the following required fields:

* `spender`: The account that is allowed to spend the tokens.
* `amount`: The maximum amount of tokens to be spent by the spender.

Additionally, the transaction takes the following optional fields:

* `from_subaccount`: The subaccount of the approver.
* `expected_allowance`: If set, this field serves as a guarantee that before the new approved amount is set, the expected allowance reflects the previously set approved amount.
* `expires_at`: The timestamp at which the allowance will expire.
* `fee`: The fee paid by the approver for the approval. If not set, the default fee will have to be paid.
* `memo`: An arbitrary 32 bytes array to ensure transaction hash uniqueness.
* `created_at_time`: A timestamp that is used to trigger the [deduplication mechanism](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md#transaction_deduplication).

### dfx
Here is an example command for an `Approve` transaction using `dfx`:
```bash
dfx canister call icrc1_ledger_canister icrc2_approve "(record { amount = 500; spender = record{owner = principal \"sckqo-e2vyl-4rqqu-5g4wf-pqskh-iynjm-46ixm-awluw-ucnqa-4sl6j-mqe\";} })"
```

### Rust
Here is an example Rust code snippet for making an `Approve` transaction:
```bash
let spender = icrc_ledger_types::icrc1::account::Account{ owner:ic_principal::Principal::from_slice(&[1, 2, 3, 4]) , subaccount: None};
let amount = candid::Nat::from(500u64);
let approve_args = icrc_ledger_types::icrc1::approve::ApproveArgs{
    from_subaccount: None,
    spender,
    amount,
    expected_allowance: None,
    expires_at: None,
    fee: None,
    memo: : None,
    created_at_time: : None,
}
candid::Decode!(&ic_agent.update("icrc2_approve", &candid::Encode!(&approve_args)?).await.unwrap(), Result<candid::Nat, icrc_ledger_types::icrc2::approve::ApproveError>).unwrap();
```

## Transferring approved tokens
To transfer approved tokens, your transaction will need the following required fields:
* `to`: The account that will receive the tokens.
* `from`: The approvers account who's tokens will be transferred.
* `amount`: The amount of tokens to be sent.
Additionally, the transaction takes the following optional fields:
* `spender_subaccount`: The subaccount of the spender.
* `fee`: The fee paid by the sender for the transfer. If not set the default fee will have to be paid.
* `memo`: An arbitrary 32 bytes array to ensure transaction hash uniqueness.
* `created_at_time`: A timestamp that is used to trigger the [deduplication mechanism](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md#transaction_deduplication).

### dfx
Here is an example command for a `TransferFrom` transaction using `dfx`:
```bash
dfx canister call icrc1_ledger_canister icrc2_transfer_from "(record { from = record { owner = principal \"ltyfs-qiaaa-aaaak-aan3a-cai\";}; to = record { owner = principal \"sckqo-e2vyl-4rqqu-5g4wf-pqskh-iynjm-46ixm-awluw-ucnqa-4sl6j-mqe\";};  amount = 500;})"
```

### Rust
Here is an example Rust code snippet for making a `TransferFrom` transaction:
```bash
let to = icrc_ledger_types::icrc1::account::Account{ owner:ic_principal::Principal::from_slice(&[1, 2, 3, 4]) , subaccount: None};
let from = icrc_ledger_types::icrc1::account::Account{ owner:ic_principal::Principal::from_slice(&[5, 6, 7, 8]) , subaccount: None};
let amount = candid::Nat::from(500u64);
let transfer_from_arg = icrc_ledger_types::icrc1::transfer_from::TransferFromArgs{
    spender_subaccount: None,
    from,
    to,
    amount,
    fee: None,
    memo: : None,
    created_at_time: : None,
}
candid::Decode!(&ic_agent.update("icrc2_transfer_from", &candid::Encode!(&transfer_from_arg)?).await.unwrap(), Result<candid::Nat, icrc_ledger_types::icrc2::transfer_from::TransferFromError>).unwrap();
```
