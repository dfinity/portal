# Signing transactions

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Bitcoin"]} />

Before a transaction can be sent to the Bitcoin network, each input must be signed.

## Threshold ECDSA

Canisters can sign transactions with threshold ECDSA through the [`sign_with_ecdsa`](btc-api.mdx) method.

The following snippet shows a simplified example of how to sign a Bitcoin transaction for the special case where all the inputs are referencing outpoints that are owned by `own_address` and `own_address` is a `P2PKH` address.

## Threshold Schnorr

Canisters can sign transactions with threshold Schnorr through the [`sign_with_schnorr`](btc-api.mdx) method.

### Signing P2TR key path transactions
