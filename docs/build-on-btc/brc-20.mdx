# BRC-20 tokens

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Bitcoin", "Tutorial"]} />

A BRC-20 token is a type of fungible token created using the [Bitcoin Ordinals protocol](/build-on-btc/ordinals). These tokens are inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain using JSON payloads that defines the token's properties. Like other fungible tokens, BRC-20 tokens can be minted and transferred between Bitcoin addresses.

BRC-20 tokens are deployed by embedding structured JSON into a Taproot witness script. This is similar to standard Ordinals inscriptions but follows a specific format that defines token metadata. The deployment process involves two transactions:

- Commit: Sends satoshis to a Taproot address that commits to the inscription (the BRC-20 script).

- Reveal: Spends the committed satoshis, revealing the JSON inscription that contains the token definition.

Once deployed, the BRC-20 inscription becomes permanently linked to the specific satoshis used in the reveal transaction. According to BRC-20 standards, the first valid deployment of a ticker symbol is treated as the canonical version that establishes the official instance of that token.

## Inscribe a BRC-20 token

```rust reference
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/rust/basic_bitcoin/src/service/inscribe_brc20.rs#L42-L210
```

This implementation uses fixed deployment parameters for simplicity:

- Max supply: 21_000_000 tokens.

- Mint limit: 1_000 tokens per mint operation.
