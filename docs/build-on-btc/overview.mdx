# Build on Bitcoin

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Bitcoin" ]} />

ICP brings smart contract functionality to Bitcoin that opens up new possibilities for DeFi and dapp development.

Through a protocol-level integration with the [Bitcoin network](/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/bitcoin/overview), smart contracts deployed on ICP can interact with the Bitcoin network directly without using a bridge or oracle. ICP smart contracts can query the [Bitcoin mainnet for testnet](/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/bitcoin/using-btc/read-state) for network state information or the balance of any Bitcoin address. They can also [hold BTC](/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/bitcoin/using-btc/generate-addresses) or [sign](/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/bitcoin/using-btc/sign-transactions) and [submit transactions](/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/bitcoin/using-btc/submit-transactions) to the Bitcoin network.

From a high level, ICP's integration with Bitcoin has three components:

- **Threshold signatures, including [threshold ECDSA](/docs/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-ecdsa)** and **[threshold Schnorr](/docs/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-schnorr)** signatures: A smart contract can have a secret key that is stored in a secure and decentralized manner using [chain-key cryptography](/docs/references/bitcoin-how-it-works#chain-key-signatures). ECDSA and Schnorr signatures are both compatible with Bitcoin.

- **Bitcoin adapter**: Some of the ICP nodes participate in the Bitcoin network. They communicate with the Bitcoin networks (testnet v4 and mainnet) through a networking process referred to as the Bitcoin adapter.

- **Bitcoin API**: An ICP smart contract that exposes methods callable by other smart contracts. It holds the onchain Bitcoin state, UTXO set, and outgoing transactions. The Bitcoin API runs on the nodes that participate in the Bitcoin network.

When an ICP smart contract wants to submit a Bitcoin transaction, first it must generate a BTC address and create the transaction. Then, it must sign the transaction and make a request to the Bitcoin API asking to submit the transaction.

The Bitcoin API queues the request to be sent to the Bitcoin network through the Bitcoin adapter. The Bitcoin network processes the request asynchronously, then returns the result of the transaction to the Bitcoin API, which then forwards it to the ICP smart contract that initially created the transaction.
