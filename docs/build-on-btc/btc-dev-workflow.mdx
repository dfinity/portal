# BTC developer workflow

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Bitcoin" ]} />

To build Bitcoin dapps, a developer needs to make calls and submit transactions to the Bitcoin network from their ICP smart contract. Each ICP smart contract can have its own Bitcoin addresses, hold and control BTC, and sign and submit transactions directly to the Bitcoin mainnet or testnet.

Before you start building your BTC dapp, you will need to [setup a local development environment](btc-dev-env.mdx).

Developers should expect to implement some or more of the following functions to build a BTC dapp:

- [Generate a Bitcoin address](generate-addresses.mdx) by calling either the [`ecdsa_public_key` API endpoint](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-ecdsa_public_key) or the [`schnorr_public_key` API endpoint](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-schnorr_public_key).

- [Create a Bitcoin transaction](./create-transactions.mdx).

- [Sign a transaction](./sign-transactions.mdx) using the [`sign_with_ecdsa` API endpoint](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-sign_with_ecdsa) or [`sign_with_schnorr` API endpoint](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-sign_with_schnorr). Transactions cannot be sent to the Bitcoin network until they are signed.

- [Submit a transaction](./submit-transactions.mdx) using the Bitcoin API's [`bitcoin_send_transaction`](https://github.com/dfinity/bitcoin-canister/blob/master/INTERFACE_SPECIFICATION.md#bitcoin_send_transaction) endpoint, which must specify the `blob` of a Bitcoin transaction and a Bitcoin network (mainnet or testnet).

- [Read information from the Bitcoin network](read-state.mdx) using one of the the [Bitcoin API endpoints](#bitcoin-api-endpoints).

Popular libraries like [`rust-bitcoin`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin) and [`bitcoinjs-lib`](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib) can be used within ICP smart contracts.
