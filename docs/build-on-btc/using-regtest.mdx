# Using Bitcoin regtest

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Bitcoin"]} />

Before using the local Bitcoin regtest instance, you will need to:

- [x] [Setup the local developer environment](/docs/build-on-btc/btc-dev-env).

- [x] Clone the `@dfinity/examples` repo: `git clone https://github.com/dfinity/examples.git`

This page will demonstrate how to use the local Bitcoin regtest instance using the [`basic_bitcoin` example](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/basic_bitcoin) project written in Rust. Alternatively, you can use the Motoko variation of this project.

If you are using macOS, an `llvm` version that supports the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is required. This is because the Rust `bitcoin` library relies on `secp256k1-sys`, which requires `llvm` to build. The default `llvm` version provided by XCode does not meet this requirement. Instead, install the [Homebrew version](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/llvm), using `brew install llvm`.

The `basic_bitcoin` example provides a simple smart contract that implements methods for sending and receiving bitcoin. It supports P2PKH (legacy), P2PWKH (SegWit), and P2TR (Taproot) address types. 

Navigate into the `rust/basic_bitcoin` subdirectory of the examples repo:

```jsx
cd examples/rust/basic_bitcoin
```

:::caution
When you set up your [developer environment](/docs/build-on-btc/btc-dev-env), if you created the subdirectory for your `bitcoin_data` files in another project's directory, you either need to [make them again or copy them](/docs/build-on-btc/btc-dev-env#step-2-create-a-subdirectory-for-bitcoin-data) into this project's folder.
:::

Then start the local Bitcoin regtest network:

```jsx
bitcoind -conf=$(pwd)/bitcoin.conf -datadir=$(pwd)/bitcoin_data --port=18444
```

Next, deploy the project to your local development environment with the `dfx deploy` command and specify the `regtest` network as an init argument for the project:

```
dfx start --clean --enable-bitcoin --background // If dfx is not already running
dfx deploy basic_bitcoin --argument '(variant { regtest })'
```

## Make calls to the local Bitcoin regtest

### Generating a Bitcoin address

The Bitcoin network uses different types of addresses (e.g., P2PKH, P2SH), most of which can be generated from an ECDSA public key. The `basic_bitcoin` example implements a function for generating a P2PKH address using the [`ecdsa_public_key`](/docs/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-ecdsa_public_key) API endpoint.

You can call this function from the command line:

```
dfx canister call basic_bitcoin get_p2pkh_address
```

### Receiving BTC

A key difference between working with a local Bitcoin regtest and the Bitcoin testnet or mainnet is how you receive BTC. In order to receive BTC on your local Bitcoin testnet, you need to manually mine blocks. BTC is issued as a reward for each block mined.

:::info Coinbase maturity

One caveat of using a local Bitcoin regtest and receiving block rewards is that the rewards are subject to the [Coinbase maturity rule](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/bace615ba31cedec50afa4f296934a186b9afae6/src/consensus/consensus.h#L19), which states that in order for you to spend rewarded BTC, you will first need to mine 100 blocks.

:::

In the same directory as `bitcoind`, you can issue the following command to mine blocks:

```bash
bitcoin-cli -conf=$(pwd)/bitcoin.conf generatetoaddress <number-of-blocks> <btc-address>
```

After mining a block, its hash will be returned. In the `dfx` logs, you will see a log entry confirming that `dfx` has ingested the newly mined block. Syncing the first bitcoin block can take up to 30 seconds. Subsequent blocks sync nearly instantly.

Then check your BTC balance:

```
dfx canister call basic_bitcoin get_balance '("<btc-address>")'
```

:::danger

The BTC you mine is valid only in your local Bitcoin regtest and cannot be spent or used elsewhere.

:::

### Sending BTC

You can send BTC using the `send_from_${type}` function of the `basic_bitcoin` smart contract, where `${type}` is one of the following:

- `p2pkh_address`

- `p2tr_key_only_address`

- `p2tr_address_key_path`

- `p2tr_address_script_path`

```
dfx canister call basic_bitcoin send_from_p2pkh_address '(record { destination_address = "n2dcQfuwFw7M2UYzLfM6P7DwewsQaygb8S"; amount_in_satoshi = 100000000; })'
```

This command creates a transaction and sends it to your local Bitcoin regtest. Now, you need to mine a block so that the transaction you just sent becomes part of the blockchain:

```
bitcoin-cli -conf=$(pwd)/bitcoin.conf generatetoaddress 1 mtbZzVBwLnDmhH4pE9QynWAgh6H3aC1E6M
```

[View the full details of the `generatetoaddress` command](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/generatetoaddress.html)

## Getting a block’s information

To get information about a specific block, use the `getblock` command:

```bash
bitcoin-cli -conf=$(pwd)/bitcoin.conf -regtest getblock <block-hash> <verbosity>
```

This command requires the block’s hash value and an optional verbosity level:

- 0: Hex-encoded data
- 1: JSON objects
- 2: JSON objects with transaction data

[View the full details of the `getblock` command](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getblock.html)

## Getting raw transaction data

To get raw information about a transaction, use the `getrawtransaction` command:

```bash
bitcoin-cli -conf=$(pwd)/bitcoin.conf -regtest getrawtransaction <tx-id> <verbosity>
```

This command requires the transaction’s ID, an optional verbosity level, and block hash value.

[View the full details of the `getrawtransaction` command](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getrawtransaction.html).

## Troubleshooting

### Sending transactions

If you're trying to send a transaction and the transaction isn't being mined, try sending the same transaction using `bitcoin-cli`, as it can reveal helpful errors:

```
bitcoin-cli -conf=$(pwd)/bitcoin.conf sendrawtransaction <tx-in-hex>
```

### Resetting the state

It's often useful to delete the entire local Bitcoin state and start from scratch. To do this:

- #### Step 1: Run the following commands in the directory of your `dfx` project to delete the local state of `dfx`.

```
dfx stop
rm -rf .dfx
```

:::caution
Running `rm -rf .dfx` will permanently delete *all* the ICP smart contracts you have created locally.
:::

- #### Step 2: In the folder where you're running `bitcoind`, stop the `bitcoind` process if it is running, and then delete the data folder you created.

```
rm -r data
mkdir data
```
