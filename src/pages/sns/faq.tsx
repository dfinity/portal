            <Faq title="What is a DAO?">
              <p>
                DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Simply
                put, a DAO is an organization formed by smart contracts where
                the members (typically token holders) collectively decide how
                the organization or the product evolves. Example scenarios:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  10'000 token holders each deposit crypto into a smart contract
                  and vote on what to purchase with the total.
                </li>
                <li>
                  1 million token holders control a decentralized version of
                  Twitter where token holders propose and vote on feature
                  updates.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                A DAO can take the role of carrying out community-driven
                decisions on when and how to update the code that shapes the
                organization or product.

            <Faq title="What is an SNS?">
              <p>
                SNS stands for Service Nervous System. An SNS is a powerful form
                of DAO that allows communities to govern smart contracts and
                decentralized apps (dapps) running on the Internet Computer
                (ICP) completely on chain. Main things to note about SNS:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The design of SNSs is similar to that of the{" "}
                  <Link href="https://nns.ic0.app">
                    Network Nervous System (NNS)
                  </Link>
                  , which is the on-chain DAO that governs the whole ICP.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A dapp controlled by an SNS DAO is governed by SNS token
                  holders submitting and voting on on-chain proposals. No one
                  developer or group of people controls the dapp, rather the
                  dapp is controlled by voting via tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There can be many SNSs on ICP. A developer can turn their dapp
                  into a DAO by handing the control of their dapp over to an SNS
                  DAO.
                </li>

            <Faq title="How unique are SNS DAOs in Web3?">
              <p>
                DAOs are a growing form of organization for accomplishing goals.
                For example, in the ETH ecosystem, Uniswap and MakerDAO are
                popular DAOs with billions of dollars locked in their respective
                smart contracts. However,{" "}
                <strong>
                  ICP is unique in that it can host fully-on chain dapps
                </strong>{" "}
                (frontend, backend application logic, and data), so SNS DAOs are
                unique in that they can fully control (via voting) every aspect
                of a dapp, since everything is on-chain. Having fully on-chain
                DAOs is important because it enables all decisions to execute on
                the blockchain. This is in contrast to existing DAOs on other
                blockchains where voting takes place on-chain but the execution
                of the results are often carried out by developers off-chain.
                This facilitates true decentralization.{" "}
                <p>
                  Therefore, SNS DAOs serve as a vehicle to deliver fully
                  decentralized online services that are owned and governed by
                  their communities.{" "}

              SNS-1 is the first SNS DAO that DFINITY launched on the mainnet to
              test an SNS decentralization sale with involvement of the ICP
              community. The SNS-1 test exposed areas of improvement, which are
              currently being addressed. The SNS-1 dapp is now controlled by the
              community of token holders who will collectively determine its
              future. Since SNS-1 was meant as a test, it is unusual among SNSs
              in that it was launched as a blank canvas without a product or
              developer team. Future SNSs will likely be derived from
              established ICP dapps. SNS-1 tokens are available on{" "}

              Once you have acquired SNS tokens, you can lock them into SNS
              neurons and create a proposal or vote on one. Depending on the SNS
              configuration, users who vote may be rewarded with additional
              tokens for participating in governance. If you want to get more
              deeply involved, you can also suggest feature updates through
              proposals to improve the dapp controlled by the DAO.

              <p>There are three main ways of acquiring SNS tokens:</p>

                <li>
                  <strong>Participate in a decentralization sale:</strong> When
                  an SNS launches, it has to go through a decentralization sale.
                  You can participate on the NNS frontend dapp under the{" "}

                    Purchase tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX):

                  After a decentralization sale has concluded, liquid tokens
                  will typically be listed on multiple DEXs, where you can buy
                  them using the ICP utility token or other tokens, depending on
                  what token pairs the DEX lists, e.g., also Bitcoin or
                  Ethereum. An SNS token in high demand may have a higher price
                  on a DEX than in its decentralization sale.{" "}
                  <Link href="http://icdex.io/">ICDex</Link> already supports
                  SNS tokens.

                <li>
                  <strong>Airdrops:</strong> Besides buying SNS tokens, you can
                  obtain them by receiving airdrops or by engaging with the dapp
                  and thereby earning tokens as reward. In this scenario, tokens
                  are used as an incentive to encourage active engagement with
                  the dapp which helps grow the active user base. Finally, if
                  you already have tokens and participate in governance, you can
                  earn tokens as voting rewards as you would in the NNS.

            <Faq title="What is the Community Fund?">
              <p>
                From the ICP ecosystem's vantage point, the Community Fund aids
                in bootstrapping the SNS DAO ecosystem, and re-invests in the
                continued growth of the ecosystem. The Community Fund itself is
                controlled by a DAO (the NNS).

                From a user's vantage point, the Community Fund is a way for
                people who stake ICP in the NNS to use their maturity to fund
                future SNSs, which results in higher diversification. As the NNS
                decides how the Community Fund is distributed, those
                participating in it can leverage the broader community's "wisdom
                of crowds" to decide which SNS tokens to acquire.

            <Faq title="Where does a decentralization sale take place?">
              <p>
                A decentralization sale is run entirely on chain. The sale is
                initiated by the NNS. Through this approach, every aspect of the
                sale, from its initiation to execution, is completely
                decentralized and not controlled by any centralized entity. Even
                the decision to create the SNS and its token is made by the NNS
                (a DAO) and not the developer in order to avoid undesirable
                legal implications for the developer who wants to decentralize
                their app.
              </p>
              <p>
                A decentralization sale follows a list of configurable

                If the decentralization sale is successful, you will receive a
                basket of{" "}
                <Link href="https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Neurons_101">
                  neurons
                </Link>{" "}
                that hold your SNS tokens. The basket may contain multiple
                neurons with different dissolve delays, depending on the SNS
                configuration. You can use your tokens to participate in
                governance or, once neurons have dissolved, sell the liquid
                tokens on an exchange.
              </p>
              <p>
                The number of SNS tokens you receive, and the price paid for
                each token, depends on the amount of ICP raised during the sale.
                The more ICP raised, the fewer SNS tokens you receive.

              <p>
                Once the sale ends and is successful, you receive SNS tokens.
                The number of SNS tokens you receive, and the price paid for
                each token, depends on the amount of ICP raised during the sale
                as well as the amount of ICP spent. The more ICP raised, the
                fewer SNS tokens you receive.

              <p>
                If the set goals of the decentralization sale are not reached,
                participants will be refunded. The duration of a sale is
                configurable and thus, depends on the configuration of each
                individual SNS. A sale can only start after a 4 to 8-day NNS
                voting period (unless 51% majority is reached sooner) on the
                original proposal that initiates the launch the SNS.

            <Faq title="Is it possible to transfer SNS tokens to another person?">
              <p>
                Yes. SNS tokens are ICRC-1 tokens and can be transferred between
                any Internet Computer-based wallets that support ICRC-1,
                including your NNS wallet. Note that each SNS has its own
                ICRC-1-compliant ledger for keeping track of its tokens.
              </p>
              <p>
                When receiving your SNS tokens in the form of neurons, the
                neurons may have dissolve delays, meaning your tokens may not be
                liquid, i.e. transferable immediately. Rather these tokens
                become liquid (transferable) in weeks, months, or years’ time,
                depending on the dissolve delay of the respective neuron.
              </p>
            </Faq>
            <Faq title="Is it possible to sell SNS tokens to another person?">
              <p>
                Yes. Because tokens can be sent to other people, they can
                likewise be sent to exchanges and thus swapped for other tokens.
                The easiest way to sell SNS tokens is through a decentralized
                exchange (DEX) that lists the token. You can exchange SNS tokens
                for other tokens, depending on the token pairs available on any
                DEX.
              </p>
              <p>
                Likewise, you can acquire SNS tokens on a DEX in exchange for
                other tokens.
              </p>
            </Faq>
            <Faq title="Are SNS tokens inflationary or deflationary?">
              <p>
                This depends on the specific SNS configuration. An SNS DAO can
                have both inflationary and deflationary pressures.
              </p>
              <p>Inflationary:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An SNS DAO can be set up to mint voting rewards for people who
                  participate in governance (similar to ICP).
                </li>
                <li>
                  An SNS DAO can mint tokens if voted on by SNS token holders.
                  For example: a game mints 2% of total supply each year and
                  distributes it among players.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Deflationary:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>SNS tokens are burnt for every transaction.</li>
                <li>
                  Locking SNS tokens into neurons removes them from circulation.
                  While not technically deflation, it acts as a deflationary
                  pressure.
