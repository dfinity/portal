        Step into the era of blockchain as a limitless smart contract cloud that hosts everything on-chain: 
        data, content, computations, and user experiences. Forget legacy IT and build tamperproof and unstoppable 
        Web3 social media, gaming, virtual reality, decentralized finance, and enterprise infrastructure. 
        Join the movement and realize the game-changing Internet Computer paradigm of full stack decentralization 
        and seamless multi-chain today.
          <CollapsedVisionSection>
          You will be in good company. The Internet Computer network's ICP protocol was created by the 
          crypto industry’s largest R&D operation in a multi-year international effort – it’s the product 
          of more than 1,000 person years of research and development at the DFINITY Foundation, including work 
          by world famous cryptographers and engineers focused on a singular vision: deliver infinite blockchain 
          that can be used as an alternative to traditional IT.
