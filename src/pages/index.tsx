        Say hello to super advanced blockchain, reimagined as an infinite smart contract cloud, 
        hosting not just tokens, but all the data, content, logic, computation and user experiences 
        of web3 social media, game, metaverse and DeFi, alongside enterprise services, fully on-chain, 
        realizing World Computer "full stack decentralization" on a public network for the first time.
          <CollapsedVisionSection>
            A network formed by the IC protocol, created through a relentless
            R&D operation incorporating hundreds of person-years development
            effort by an eminent technical team with more than 100,000 academic
            citations. Today, web3 has become Web 3.0, and full stack
            decentralization has become easy. For the first time, "open internet
            services" are being created that run fully on-chain under true
            community DAO control. Today, Al models are running as smart
            contracts. Native multi-chain crypto delivers World Computer. The
            battle for the future of the internet, and compute itself, has
            begun.
