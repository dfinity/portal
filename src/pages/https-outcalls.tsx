            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
              Today, the majority of the world's API-accessible data, such as
              stock prices, football scores, IoT-related data, or crypto
              exchange prices, is hosted on Web 2.0 services, which is outside
              the secure on-chain walls of a blockchain. As smart contract
              software often relies on external web 2-hosted data to implement
              useful functionality, it is crucial that this data be accessible,
              first to unfold the full potential of smart contracts, and second,
              to pave the way for blockchain singularity, whereby the majority
              of computations run on the blockchain.
            </p>
            <h3>The Oracle Problem</h3>
            <p>
              A common limitation of blockchain technology is that smart
              contracts can receive messages, but cannot send them to the world
              outside the blockchain. For example, typical smart contracts can
              receive messages, but cannot send emails and SMS's, nor can they
              query wikipedia or send HTTP requests to other services.
              Historically, this has been a blocker to most software developers
              diving into Web3. For this reason, obtaining off-chain data
              requires that a smart contract interact with centralized oracle
              services, which are in the hands of intermediaries, vulnerable to
              hacking, and subject to service fees.
            </p>

            <h3>HTTPS Outcalls Replace Oracles</h3>
            <p>
              Canister HTTPS outcalls on the Internet Computer blockchain allow
              direct interaction with Web 2.0 and other blockchains without
              oracles. Canister smart contracts can make HTTPS outcalls to
              specified URLs to directly obtain off-chain data, or to interact
              with off-chain systems, such as Web 2.0 services or enterprise IT
              infrastructure.
