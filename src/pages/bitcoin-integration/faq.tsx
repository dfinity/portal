            <Faq title="What is Bitcoin integration?">
              <p>
                The Internet Computer (ICP) integrates with the Bitcoin network
                at a protocol level. This means ICP canister smart contracts can create   
                Bitcoin addresses as well as send and receive bitcoin directly on the 
                Bitcoin network. And, Bitcoin can easily and securely be incorporated
                into DeFi and Web3 services on the Internet Computer blockchain,
                without having to trust centralized bridging services, which are 
                at high risk of being taken down or hacked.
              </p>
              <p>
                This integration with the Bitcoin network is made up of two key building blocks:{" "}
                <strong>Network integration</strong> and <strong>chain-key ECDSA</strong>.
                Combining these building blocks, canisters can directly and
                securely hold, receive, and send bitcoin seamlessly as if the
                Internet Computer and the Bitcoin network were one blockchain.
                Another way of looking at it, is that the Bitcoin integration
                is the same as running a Bitcoin node on chain.
              </p>
            </Faq>

            <Faq title="What does direct integration with the Bitcoin network really mean?">
              <p>
                One key tech development allowing smart contracts on the Internet
                Computer to obtain the balances of Bitcoin addresses as well as
                directly send and receive bitcoin is inter-chain communication.
                As the ICP blockchain creates transactions for the Bitcoin
                blockchain, its nodes directly transmit these transactions to the
                nodes of the Bitcoin network, without any need for intermediaries
                that might censor them. ICP nodes also directly pull blocks from
                the Bitcoin network to maintain Bitcoin's current UTXO set,
                allowing canisters to query the balance of Bitcoin addresses
                and their UTXOs. Creating bitcoin transactions and querying UTXO
                sets are made available to canisters by the Bitcoin API.
              </p>
            </Faq>

            <Faq title="What is chain-key ECDSA?">
              <p>
                The real innovation behind Bitcoin integration is chain-key ECDSA
                signing â€” advanced threshold cryptography build into the Internet Computer.
                In short, chain-key ECDSA is a set of cryptographic protocols that
                allow ICP nodes to cooperatively create ECDSA signatures, 
                which can be used to sign bitcoin transactions, using
                a highly fault-tolerant, decentralized network that is resilient
                to attacks by malicious nodes. The secret key is never stored in
                one place, instead it is broken down into key shares held by ICP
                nodes that are re-shared periodically. When requested, nodes
                use their key shares to collectively sign BTC transactions without
                recreating the original secret key. This signing protocol assumes
                a threshold of nodes to be honest.

              Chain-key bitcoin (ckBTC) is a multi-chain bitcoin twin that can be
              sent with 1-2 second finality and negligible fees. It is trustlessly
              created by chain-key cryptography and a pair of canister smart

              intermediaries.

              <p className="tw-paragraph mb-3">
                ckBTC isn't considered a wrapped token because it doesn't involve 
                centralized custodians or bridges to work. More than a token, while
                ckBTC implements the ICRC-1 fungible token standard, it is a pair of
                canister smart contracts that allow bitcoin to be freely sent between
                addresses either on the Bitcoin network or the Internet Computer,
                making it the first true multi-chain asset.

            <Faq
              title="How does ckBTC compare to the Lightning Network?"
              id="how-do-you-get-sns-tokens"
            >
              <p>
                The Lightning Network is the most well known Layer-2 for Bitcoin.
                Like ckBTC, it allows fast and cheap transfers of BTC value off
                the Bitcoin blockchain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike Lightning, ckBTC does not require peer-to-peer payment
                channels to be established and funded. This means that your full
                ckBTC balance can always be transferred â€” no network liquidity
                limitations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Canister smart contracts can programmatically hold and transfer
                ckBTC, making it possible to develop fully on-chain Layer-2
                applications for Bitcoin, which is not possible using the
                Lightning Network.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another key difference is that ckBTC transaction fees are fixed,
                and not dependent on the transaction amount, variable intermediate
                forwarding, or unexpected channel funding fees.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the future, ckBTC will be available on other networks like
                Ethereum â€“ also directly, and without bridges, thanks to chain-key
                cryptography integrations.
              </p>
            </Faq>

            <Faq title="Does ckBTC incorporate KYT?">
              <p>
                Yes, cross-chain transactions go through KYT checks to protect honest users.
                Know Your Transaction (KYT) is a process that monitors and tracks financial 
                transactions in order to detect and prevent fraudulent or criminal activity, 
                such as money laundering or terrorist financing. 
              </p>
              <p>
                If ckBTC were to operate without a KYT implementation, there would be a risk
                of 'tainted' bitcoin entering the Internet Computer, that an honest
                user could unknowingly withdraw. Such bitcoin may be rejected by CEXs, which 
                means honest users could potentially lose their bitcoin when tryng to sell.
              </p>
              <p>
                KYT is an important security component of ckBTC. Read more about how ckBTC
