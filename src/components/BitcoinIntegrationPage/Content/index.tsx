            Native Bitcoin
          </h2>
          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-3">
            The Internet Computer (ICP) is integrated with the Bitcoin network
            at the protocol level. The canister smart contracts it hosts can
            create Bitcoin addresses as well as send and receive bitcoin
            directly on the Bitcoin network. This means bitcoin can be easily
            and securely incorporated into DeFi and Web3 services on the
            Internet Computer blockchain, without having to trust wrapped
            bitcoin from centralized bridging services, which are at high risk
            of being taken down or hacked, and can lead to billions of dollars
            in bitcoin losses.
          </p>
          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-3">
            The ICP x BTC integration comprises two key building blocks (and
            APIs): <strong>Network Integration & Chain-Key ECDSA</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-3">
            Combining these building blocks, ICP canisters can directly and
            securely hold, receive, and send bitcoin seamlessly as if the
            Internet Computer and the Bitcoin network were one blockchain.
            Another way of looking at it, is that the Bitcoin integration
            is the same as running a Bitcoin node on chain.

              One key tech development allowing smart contracts on the Internet
              Computer to obtain the balances of Bitcoin addresses as well as
              directly send and receive bitcoin is inter-chain communication. As
              the ICP blockchain creates transactions for the Bitcoin
              blockchain, its nodes directly transmit the transaction to the
              Bitcoin network's nodes, without any need for intermediaries that
              might censor them. ICP nodes also directly pull blocks from the
              Bitcoin network to maintain Bitcoin's current UTXO set, allowing
              canisters to query the amount of digital currency, or balance, per
              Bitcoin address and its UTXOs. The functionality of sending
              Bitcoin transactions and querying balances and UTXO sets is
              accessed by canisters through the Bitcoin API.

            </h3>
            <p className="tw-paragraph mb-0">
              The real magic behind Bitcoin integration is chain-key ECDSA
              signing — advanced threshold cryptography integrated with ICP.
              This is what enables ICP nodes to cooperatively create new Bitcoin
              addresses and sign Bitcoin transactions, using highly
              fault-tolerant, decentralized network protocols that are resilient
              to attacks by malicious nodes. The secret key is never stored in
              one place, instead it is broken down into key shares held by ICP
              nodes that are re-shared every 5-10 mins. When requested,
              nodes sign BTC transactions using the key shares without recreating
              the original secret key. Building on tECDSA, this protocol assumes
              a threshold of nodes to be honest. The process is called ckECDSA
              signing.

            In 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to use
            Bitcoin as legal tender. However, as bitcoin transactions are slow
            and have high fees, they are not practical for daily economic
            activities such as buying groceries or getting a coffee.
          </p>  
          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-3">
            The Bitcoin network integration on the Internet Computer (ICP) is
            extremely powerful in terms of security and interoperability, but
            every bitcoin transaction still suffers the same low throughput,
            high latency, and high fees native to the Bitcoin network.
            Transaction fees alone can be higher than the cost of an espresso
            in El Salvador. Chain-key Bitcoin (ckBTC), a bitcoin ‘twin’ on ICP
            introduces layer 2 functionality fuelled by ICP properties like
            speed, scalability and low transaction fees to bitcoin. ckBTC makes
            using bitcoin practical for everyday transactions.
          </p>
          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-3">
            End-users can seemlessly transfer bitcoin
            any time between blockchains without any third-party bridges or custodians.
          </p>
          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-3">
            ckBTC is compliant with ICRC-1, the fungible token
            standard on ICP, and can be integrated easily by any service, e.g.,
            wallets or DEXs.

          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-3">
            Most blockchains rely on so-called bridges to wrap and unwrap
            tokens, such as bitcoin. The recent incident where the FTX exchange
            acted as the custodian, and Sollet the bridge for wrapping and
            unwrapping BTC and ETH on Solana, demonstrated how bridges and
            intermediaries are highly vulnerable to hacks or other forms of
            compromise.
          </p>
          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-8">
            ckBTC is issued and redeemed via a canister smart contract — 
            no bridge or custodian, and verifiable by anyone. The ckBTC 
            canister is controlled by the NNS DAO, which means no single 
            entity can initiate malicious activities without the approval 
            of ICP governance token holders.

          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-0 font-bold">Not a Lightning Network</p>
          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-3">
            While a lightning network has many advantages, such as faster
            transactions and lower fees, transactions go through many channels
            that run on centralized cloud systems. ckBTC brings layer 2
            functionality to the Bitcoin network — fast, low-fee payments —
            without the risk or limitations of a lightning network in that all
            transactions are held on the ckBTC ledger and never go through
            centralized channels.

          <p className="tw-paragraph mb-0">
            True decentralized transactions on the Internet Computer are made
