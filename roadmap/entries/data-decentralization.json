Currently this process is cumbersome and this feature is about streamlining the process and making it more user friendly. This milestone aims to create a process and technical means to support public contributions to the ic repository. It includes ensuring that no secrets can be leaked via DFINITY’s CI processes, no unauthorised access can be gained to DFINITY’s internal infrastructure and that no bad or malicious code can be merged",
