  "categoryName": "Chain Fusion",
  "categoryDescription": "Chain Fusion technology enables blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana to be \"fused\" together with ICP to create a seamless single-chain end-user experience for multichain dapps. Canister smart contracts on ICP orchestrate, augment, and interact with smart contracts on other chains using advanced chain-key technology and enhance those smart contracts with ICP's special capabilities and its superior compute and storage capacity and throughput.",
