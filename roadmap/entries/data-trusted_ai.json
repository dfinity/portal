  "categoryDescription": "AI and ICP have significant potential to benefit one another. First, AI and ICP together enable the self-writing Internet. Given a description of an application, AI can write the application for you and, by deploying it as an ICP smart contract, make it available to you at a URL – just like that.  Second, AI running as a smart contract on ICP addresses the problem of users having to blindly trust AI models running on centralized servers by providing transparency into data usage and response generation.",

      "description": "AI agents are a growing paradigm in software, and the Internet Computer is uniquely positioned to be the home of AI agents. Compared to the traditional IT stack, AI agents on the Internet Computer can securely and easily manage digital assets, transact amongst each other, be fully sovereign, and be tokenized and managed by DAOs. This milestone focuses on providing access to foundational LLMs, along with basic tools to make it as simple as possible to deploy agents on the Internet Computer.",
