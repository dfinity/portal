This SNS rollout will include several features: **1.** SNSs that are provided as a system function (deployed on an SNS subnet and facilitating maintainable upgrades), **2.** A first version of voting rewards for SNSs that can be further customised in the future, **3.** Decentralization sales that decentralize a dapp, where participants provide ICP tokens in exchange for SNS tokens. **4.** A NNS frontend dapp extension that allows end users to participate in the decentralization sale. **5.** Tooling to help users initialize an SNS.
