This feature enhances replica version management by adding support to "retire" replica versions, removing them from the list of blessed replica versions. Furthermore it aims to simplify voting on replica version management by creating a separate governance topic for bless & retire replica version proposals called "repica version management", and moves subnet replica version upgrade proposals into another new governance topic called "subnet replica version management".
