When an SNS is launched, it goes through a decentralization swap. During the swap, participants provide ICP and in return receive a share of the SNS DAOâ€™s governance power in the form of SNS neurons. In the current design swaps are open for anyone to participate.

Different projects in the community have requested a feature that allows SNSs to restrict participation in the swap by geographic location. In addition, this feature enables swap participants to be presented with a custom confirmation text that they need to confirm before being allowed to participate.
