This roadmap item is based on the community proposal 55651.

This feature will require neuron owners to confirm their neuron Followee selections every 6 months. The recommended solution is to create a new button and countdown timer prominently displayed at the top of the Neurons tab in the NNS front end dapp (as well as a manage neuron command) that enables users to easily see how long they have to confirm their followee selections and to easily perform the confirmation. Caveat: A periodic reconfirmation of neuron following would presumably (at least initially) result in an active voting power of around 50% for non-governance topics. Thus, even if all voters voted, they system would have to wait for the end of the voting period which is a show-stopper for urgent updates (e.g. update of subnet). This limitation needs to be mitigated.
