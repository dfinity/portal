This roadmap item is based on the community proposal 80970.

In the current voting reward set-up, there is a financial incentive for spam because the overall reward pot is always handed out and by submitting governance spam propoals you can skew the voting reward allocation. 

This change removes this incentive by allocating voting rewards under the assumption that every neuron voted on everything. 

This change also includes moving the governance weight back to 20 and the tracking of allocated vs not allocated voting rewards.
