This change suggests a conversion from a system-based rewards model to a voter-based reward model. Voting rewards are allocated under the assumption that every neuron voted on everything. 

This change also includes moving the governance weight back to 20 without incentivising spam. We propose this occur as part of this proposal.

A result of this proposal will be a reduction in total minted ICP due to the fact that some voters do not vote on all proposals or follow a voter for all proposals. In a follow-on proposal, the NNS can determine what to do with that “abandoned” ICP. We suggest an NNS treasury but will leave it to a future proposal to finalize that.
