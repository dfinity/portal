Direct integration of the Internet Computer with the Bitcoin blockchain enables canister smart contracts to receive, hold and transfer bitcoin. With this feature, no additional trust assumptions are required, nor are additional parties, such as bridges, needed. Bitcoin integration relies on threshold ECDSA signatures that make it possible for a subnet to sign on behalf of a canister with a secret-shared key.
