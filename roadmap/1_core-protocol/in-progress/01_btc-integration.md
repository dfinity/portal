Direct integration of the Internet Computer with the Bitcoin blockchain enables canister smart contracts to receive, hold and transfer bitcoin. With this feature, neither additional trust assumptions, nor additional parties, such as bridges, are required. Bitcoin integration relies on threshold ECDSA signatures that make it possible for a subnet to sign on behalf of a canister with a secret-shared key.
