This feature directly integrates the Web 3.0 with the Web 2.0 worlds by enabling canister smart contracts on the Internet Computer to make HTTP(S) outcalls to Web 2.0 services outside the blockchain in a completely trustless manner. Using this feature, we can realize a substantial part of the functionalities currently offered by blockchain oracle services, just with better security guarantees and at a lower cost. Possible use cases include directly obtaining market data from HTTP servers for DeFi dApps and decentralized insurance services, sending notifications to end users via traditional communications channels, or implementing, by also using the threshold ECDSA feature, an Ethereum integration entirely in canister space.
