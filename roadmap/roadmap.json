This is because neuron followees are saved each time they are set for a topic. A potential solution would be to allow the user to create a followee setup, and save it once they are happy with it, or even do batch neuron actions. Another goal is to improve the NNS dapp so that special cases for proposal following become intuitively visible, for example if some proposals are not covered by the “catch-all” following or are categorized as critical.",

In the current voting reward set-up, there is a financial incentive for spam because the overall reward pot is always handed out and by submitting governance spam propoals you can skew the voting reward allocation. This change removes this incentive by allocating voting rewards under the assumption that every neuron voted on everything. This change also includes moving the governance weight back to 20 and the tracking of allocated vs not allocated voting rewards.",

            "description": "Based on collected experience and community feedback from recent SNS launches and forum discussions, we propose four enhancements to the Community Fund framework: Introduction of a ‘Matched Funding’ scheme: Instead of a fixed ICP amount, the fund’s contribution to SNS swaps should scale in line with direct participation, i.e., match the funding of the Neuron's Fund with the organic funding received during the SNS launch, allowing for a more accurate reflection of market signals. Implementation of a 10% Participation Cap: To streamline adjustments when neurons opt out during SNS proposal voting, we suggest a cap in relationship to the totals funds available. This ensures the fund’s contribution to a single SNS never exceeds 10% of the total available funds at the proposal execution time. Consequently, this automatically adjusts the fund’s participation if neurons opt out. Renaming of the ‘Community Fund’ to ‘Neurons’ Fund’: This change aims to clarify misconceptions about the fund. It emphasizes that the fund comprises neurons owned by private individuals who are exposing their maturity to promising SNS DAOs. It is suggested to release this cosmetic change next week. Reduction of the Maximum Swap Duration: A potential fund contribution is tied up and cannot be utilized for other SNS launches for the duration of the swap. To prevent a potentially unsuccessful swap from blocking a fund contribution for an extended period, we propose shortening the maximum swap duration from the current 90 days to 14 days.",

It is ready for upcoming ICP improvements. For example, it supports VM memory encryption and attestation which will further increase the security of dapps running on ICP. The new specification results in different captical expenses for the independent node providers running replica nodes. Consequently, a new NP reward structure (remuneration) is required. Based on feedback and discussion within the community, this remuneration is based on: — Higher rewards for the first nodes of a new NP in order to attract more NPs in an effort to improve ownership decentralization. — More refined rewards for nodes in new geographies, like South America, Africa, Asia and Australia, to stimulate further geographical decentralization.
