This feature enables NNS-driven deployment of boundary nodes, establishing a fully-automated installation and configuration process. The operating system, IC OS, currently used for replica nodes, will also be used for boundary nodes. This solution eliminates manual intervention by Dfinity Foundation employees and builds a basis for ongoing decentralization efforts.
