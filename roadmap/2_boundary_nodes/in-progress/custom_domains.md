This feature enables custom domains on the Internet Computer, so users will not be restricted to using the <canister id>.ic0.app domains. Users can configure the DNS entries of their domain to redirect traffic to the boundary nodes and signal the boundary nodes of the canister to which the traffic should be forwarded. Boundary nodes automatically manage the required certificates for HTTPS.
