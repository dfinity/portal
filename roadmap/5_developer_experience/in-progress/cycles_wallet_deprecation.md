The Cycles Ledger replaces the cycles wallet as the recommended solution for managing cycles across projects. Prior to
the development of the Cycles Ledger, the Cycles Wallet had been a source of confusion for many newcomers. It is not a
critical path for developing dapps on the Internet Computer and requires extensive prerequisite knowledge in order to
use effectively. Going forward, DFX will use the Cycles Ledger to make it simpler for developers to deploy code to
mainnet. The Cycles Wallet project will still be actively maintained and developers can choose to install the wallet in
their canisters.
