The current experience of using the `dfx new` command to bootstrap a new project leaves a lot to be desired - for example,
there is no ability to choose the project template or CDK - state of the art CLIs typically offer rich workflows when
bootstrapping a new project. There is an opportunity to improve this command, bringing it up to a standard that is more
in-line with the current status quo of web development environments.

The experience of using `dfx new` will be enhanced by turning the command into a workflow that encompasses several primary
facets of a modern Internet Computer program. The result will be a polished, fully formed project that a developer can
use to start coding their business logic right away.
