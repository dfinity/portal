Canister developers might want to rely on 3rd-party canisters to integrate with. These 3rd-party canisters could include Internet Computer native canisters (NNS, SNS, Ledger, â€¦), but also canisters created by the community (e.g., a decentralized exchange). To develop and test the integration, the canister author needs a simple way to install the canisters locally. Providing this requires solving multiple problems; we propose to have a coherent plan for all the sub-problems to minimize the time-to-market.
