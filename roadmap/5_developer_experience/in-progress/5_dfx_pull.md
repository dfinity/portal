In the vision of the IC as the cloud killer, canister developers depend on 3rd-party canisters that they need to integrate with. These 3rd-party canisters could include DFINITY-created canisters (NNS, SNS, Ledger, …), but also canisters created by the community (e.g., a decentralized exchange). To develop and test the integration, the canister author needs a simple way to install the canisters locally. Providing this requires solving multiple problems; we propose to have a coherent plan for all the sub-problems to minimize the time-to-market.
