Canister smart contracts on the Internet Computer can control real Bitcoin. 
However, Bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive. 
To address that limitation, we aim to introduce a new token called "chain-key Bitcoin", or ckBTC, which is an advanced form of wrapped bitcoin. 
A canister smart contract that builds on the Bitcoin integration will be able to receive bitcoin and issue ckBTC to the sender, and vice versa, users can use this canister to redeem their ckBTC for real bitcoin.
As ckBTC is a token that lives on the Internet Computer, it can be transacted efficiently and with low fees.
