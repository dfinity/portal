Canister smart contracts on the Internet Computer can control and hold real bitcoin on the Bitcoin network. 
However, Bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive. 
To address this limitation, we introduce a new token called "Chain-Key Bitcoin", or "ckBTC", which is an analogue of Bitcoin on the Internet Computer.
A canister smart contract that builds on the Bitcoin integration, especially its chain-key ECDSA technology, is able to receive bitcoin and issue ckBTC to the sender.
Vice versa, users can use this canister to redeem their ckBTC for real bitcoin.
As ckBTC is a token that lives on the Internet Computer, it can be transacted efficiently and with low fees.
The ckBTC token is backed 1:1 with real bitcoin that is publicly-verifiably held 100% on chain.
