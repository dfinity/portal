This feature brings Ethereum's Ether (ETH) token over to the IC in the form of a chain-key token, i.e., a twin token of the original ETH token on the Ethereum network. The ckETH token is important to the IC due to the potential liquidity it can bring over to the ecosystem. The initial implementation is done using HTTPS outcalls to multiple Ethereum JSON RPC providers for communication with the Ethereum network. Once available in the future, the full Ethereum integration of the Internet Computer will be leveraged for communicating with the Ethereum network in a trustless way. Chain-key ECDSA signing (threshold ECDSA) is used for trustlessly creating the required transactions on the Ethereum network.
