Remuneration model V2 is being implemented to reward node providers for operating the new Replica HW Specification. This V2 remuneration does not yet take into account penalties for unhealthy nodes, or remuneration based on decentralizaton metrics per country, city, data center. Remuneration V3 aims to add these features into a fully automated remuneration solution.
