Node Provider onboarding makes use of the dfx tool to submit proposals. Using the dfx command line tool can be complex for new node providers, and the onboarding process can be much more simplified by integrating the onboarding process into the current NNS Front End Dapp. This would allow for a more user-friendely and less technically complex onboarding experience.
