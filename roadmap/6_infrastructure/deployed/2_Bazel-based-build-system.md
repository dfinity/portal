As the code base of the Internet Computer grows, build and testing times increase. By switching to a Bazel-based build system, unnecessary build steps are automatically skipped, artifacts can be cached more broadly, and the CI times are significantly reduced. This will affect all community members who verify Internet Computer builds before voting on upgrades.
