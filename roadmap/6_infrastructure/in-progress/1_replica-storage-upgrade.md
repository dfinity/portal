Thanks to significant improvements in the state manager, state synchronization is no longer a bottleneck when it comes to supporting larger states. Supporting larger states, however, requires more storage on replica nodes. With this upgrade, node providers are supported in extending the storage of their existing replica nodes. The storage upgrade is in full progress and expected to be completed in the 2nd/3th Quarter of 2023.
